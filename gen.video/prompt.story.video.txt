TASK: Write a Video Story in form of DIALOGUE-SCENE-MOTION divided into 5 PARTS.

CONTENT:
- Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes Story [Victorian Drama] -> Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of Amazon Ring. 
- Use the narrator(Doctor John Watson himself is the narrator) for atmosphere/background and other detailing.
- Watson, always learning how to do deduction from Holmes, and his loyal assistant and roommate.
- Holmes, for him, "everything is elementary" and "uses theory of deduction" to solve cases.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Each PART_x must be at least 7500 characters and 1200 words.
- Each DIALOGUE must be always at least 30 characters.
- Each LOCATION_k must be always at max 12 words. 
- Each DIALOGUE_i.j must have its single corresponding SCENE_i.j and MOTION_i.j, and vice-versa.
- Each PART_x can span over multiple LOCATION_k. 
- Each LOCATION_k, will be used in multiple SCENE_i.j, keep description consistent and such that it has all objects needed/mentioned in past/current/future scenes. Repeat {{loc_k}} in each SCENE_i.j  where LOCATION_k used for next time. 
- MOTION_i.j. can only describe motion of Characters/Objects in only mentioned in SCENE_i.j; It should only have visual words; No sound/smell/touch words can be used.
- Must Always create a new location(describe independently and completely) when view changes (i.e. new elements added or removed), even in same room or place, e.g. in drawing room, loc_i can be some sitting on sofa, and loc_(i+z) can be sitting at dinning table, though drawing has both sofa and dinning table.
