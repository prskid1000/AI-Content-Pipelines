00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
It was a humid and rather languid summer afternoon in London,

00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,160
the sort that made the curtains of our Baker Street rooms hang heavy and motionless,

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,269
as if exhausted by their own weight.

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,960
I found myself seated opposite my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,379
who was engrossed in a monograph on African tribal poisons

00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,050
that had arrived from the Royal Colonial Society only the previous night.

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,350
Though accustomed to his wide range of interests,

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,120
I could not ignore the curiosity that uncoiled within me

00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,620
each time he delved into yet another obscure subject.

00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,500
Perhaps, I thought, he was preparing for some unknown investigation.

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,210
Or perhaps, given his peculiar temperament,

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,609
he simply wished to guard his restless mind from the creeping threat of boredom.

00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,710
Hmm, Watson, hmm.

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,329
You are gazing as though I had transformed into some curious exotic exhibit at the British Museum.

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,060
If there is a question lingering in that mind of yours,

00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,179
you might do me the kindness of voicing it

00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:59,340
instead of letting it rattle about like an unsecured carriage wheel.

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,539
..

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,579
Holmes, you misjudge me.

00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,200
I was simply wondering why you find yourself buried in treatises on African toxins.

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
I confess the subject seems a trifle remote from our usual London affairs.

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,450
Remote, yes.

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,969
Irrelevant, certainly not.

00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:21,019
Knowledge, my dear Watson, is never remote to the mind that knows how to classify it.

00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:28,620
The universe is a vast cabinet of curiosities, and one never knows which drawer may be required at any moment.

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,400
Is still, Holmes. One might assume a peaceful afternoon could be spent without fear of sudden intrigue.

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,560
Assume nothing, Watson. Peace is merely the interval before the next disturbance.

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,659
Holmes had barely concluded this remark when the sudden and sharp rap of the downstairs bell jolted.

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,240
the stillness of our rooms.

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,170
Mrs. Hudson's surprised exclamation drifted upward,

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,409
followed by the rapid footsteps of someone ascending the stairs with urgent purpose.

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,980
Holmes raised a single eyebrow,

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,760
a subtle gesture I had come to interpret as the confirmation of his own prophetic remark.

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,819
..

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,740
You see, Watson, one must never tempt fate by speaking of peaceful afternoons.

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,949
A moment later, our visitor burst into the room.

00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,740
A tall, somewhat angular gentleman with the complexion of a man

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,930
recently returned from warmer climates.

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,000
His attire bore traces of hurried travel

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,370
and in his trembling hands,

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,360
he clutched a small wooden travel cage

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,750
draped in a silk cloth.

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,790
Even through the fabric,

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,360
I could sense the faint shifting

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,949
of something alive within.

00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,360
Mr. Holmes, thank heavens you are in.

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,740
I was told that if any man in London

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,909
could prevent a catastrophe,

00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,060
it would be you.

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,319
I beg of you,

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,330
accept my apologies for the intrusion,

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,509
but I have had no peace these past 48 hours.

00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,490
Pray calm yourself, sir.

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,009
Whom's at your service?

00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:50,199
And this is my friend and chronicler, Dr. Karnicler.

00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,379
...

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:58,319
John Watson, may I ask your name and the cause of this evident distress?

00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,360
..

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,209
My name is Captain Reginald Harrington of the colonial forces stationed on the Gold Coast.

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,659
And this, this cursed creature has brought nothing but misery since I left Africa.

00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,820
..

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,819
The captain removed the silk cloth from the cage,

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:26,840
...............

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,379
This is Kimboo, an African grey-breasted parrot, a gift or rather an inheritance of sorts from

00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,719
a local chieftain who died under violent circumstances.

00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:44,840
Before his death, he pressed the bird into my hands and muttered something about it being the key to the injustice.

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,960
Since my return to London, I have been followed, threatened and nearly run down at the docks.

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:57,000
And last night, someone attempted to break into my residence, ignoring all valuables and searching only for this bird.

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,199
..

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,180
Fascinating! And what, pray tell, does the bird do that commands such a determined pursuit?

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,159
suit? It speaks, Mr. Holmes, or rather it repeats a phrase in the chieftain's native language.

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,919
The locals believed the bird had witnessed a crime. I dismissed it as superstition until the threats

00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,639
began. Holmes leaned forward, his piercing grey eyes glinting with unmistakable interest, the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,259
fingers of his steeple hands pressing together with the impatience of a mind already assembling

00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,350
assembling possibilities.

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,220
Watson, observe the plumage.

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,550
No ordinary African parrot.

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,370
Its species is known for remarkable mimicry.

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,990
Captain, repeat the phrase it utters.

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,019
I cannot, Mr. Holmes.

00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:45,689
The language is unfamiliar and the pronunciation eludes me.

00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,450
But perhaps, Kimu?

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,950
The captain tapped the cage gently.

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,560
The parrot fluffed its feathers, glanced suspiciously around the room, and then croaked a guttural

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,620
series of syllables, each pronounced with eerie clarity. The sound lingered with an unsettling

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,080
effect, as though conveying some grave warning rather than a mere echo of human speech.

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,600
Holmes, I cannot fathom what that means. Have you any notion?

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:16,159
Several, Watson, though none yet verified. Captain Harrington, when precisely did the threats begin?

00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,399
Two nights after my ship docked, at first, anonymous notes slipped under my door,

00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,639
then whispered warnings on the street,

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,689
and last evening the attempted break-in.

00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,970
I have every reason to believe someone is desperate to silence this bird.

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,039
Or retrieve what the bird represents.

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,850
The thief ignored other valuables, you say?

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,730
Then this is no random intimidation.

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:49,079
This is a targeted pursuit driven by knowledge or fear of what the parrot knows.

00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,300
I observed Holmes rise from his chair and move toward the window with the graceful precision of a whoop.

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,590
Hmm.

00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,529
Anting feeling.

00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,080
Hmm.

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,210
He opened the curtain slightly and scanned the street below.

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,050
Watson.

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,480
Hmm.

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,409
Do you note the black mustached fellow leaning against the lamppost on the opposite side of the street?

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,810
Hmm.

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,379
No?

00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,120
Hmm.

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,439
Observe carefully.

00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,540
His boots bear fresh mud, inconsistent with London's pavements,

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,779
and his coat shows the red dust of the western docks.

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:25,879
He has looked up at our windows three times since the captain entered.

00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,680
Holmes, I swear the man seems inconspicuous to my eyes.

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,250
Naturally. Observation, Watson, is seeing.

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,990
Deduction is understanding what one sees.

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,990
You must train your mind not merely to look, but to perceive.

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,289
I promise you, Holmes, I am always trying.

00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,310
A commendable effort.

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,029
Now, Captain Harrington, has anyone besides yourself handled this parrot since your departure from Africa?

00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,919
Only the chieftain's son, shortly before he passed, and a merchant at the docks who helped secure the cage.

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,930
But neither could have instigated all this.

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,519
We shall see. Tell me of the chieftain. You said he died violently?

00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,639
..

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,519
Yes, an ambush. His tent was raided. Many believed he was murdered by a rival tribe.

00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,389
Others whispered of white traders seeking to control ivory roots.

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,490
But before he died, he insisted Kimbo had seen the two-killer.

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,689
He was half delirious, but intensely insistent.

00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,720
A witness, but not a human one. Remarkable.

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,519
Holmes turned to me with that rare electric spark of excitement,

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,399
which indicated that a case worthy of his intellect had at last arrived.

00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,939
Watson, I believe our peaceful afternoon has concluded.

00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:49,800
Captain Harrington, allow me to assure you, you have come to the correct place.

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,259
But you must not return home tonight.

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,379
..

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,730
Then where shall I go?

00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,810
You will remain here at Baker Street.

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,899
Watson and I shall keep watch.

00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,519
Watch, whoever pursues this bird will not abandon their efforts quietly.

00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,879
..

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,359
Holmes, you cannot mean to invite danger into our chambers?

00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,759
Watson, danger is already waiting outside

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,660
and it would be inhospitable to keep it lingering in the street

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,509
or better to confront it on ground we control.

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,720
Holmes then approached the cage and addressed the parrot directly.

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,319
Now then, my feathered informant, let us hear your secret again.

00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:38,879
Speak, Kimbul, and let us unmask the shadow that follows you.

00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,500
...

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
The parrot stared at Holmes with an uncanny intensity,

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,440
then repeated the strange phrase,

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,069
its voice resonating through the room like a cryptic prophecy.

00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,100
And at that moment, though I did not yet understand why,

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,179
a chill crept up my spine, warning me that this case would draw us deep into a perilous mystery

00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:03,240
tree that stretched far beyond the borders of London. The evening deepened into one of those

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,860
heavy London nights where the fog presses against the windowpane, unease like a living creature,

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,159
who, muffling the outside world until it seems a distant dream, Holmes had extinguished all but

00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,190
one lamp, allowing shadows to settle along the edges of the room in silent, watchful folds.

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,860
Captain Harrington sat stiffly on the sofa, his very eyes flickering toward the cage each time

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,159
the parrot shifted its weight or rustled its feathers. As for myself, I could not deny a

00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,559
drawing apprehension, though I attempted to conceal it beneath the surface of calm professionalism

00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,339
expected of a medical man.

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,470
Watson, I trust you have loaded your service revolver.

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,279
I suspect we shall need a deterrent, though ideally not a fatal one.

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,579
Holmes, the pistol is prepared, though I sincerely hope its presence proves unnecessary.

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,750
Hope, Watson, is a luxury one may carry in one's inside pocket.

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,360
Prudence, however, I keep hosted.

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,930
stood. Holmes moved with his characteristic quiet precision, checking the locks on the windows,

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,690
the latches on the doors, and even the faint tracks of footprints upon our wooden floorboards,

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,659
although I could hardly imagine how such details would assist him considering that no one had yet

00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:14,120
entered. Still, his thoroughness was oddly reassuring. Mr. Holmes, I cannot shake the

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,279
fear that Kimball's presence here puts you both in danger. I did not intend to entangle you in

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,350
in a colonial feud.

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,940
Captain Harrington, I assure you,

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,980
danger is an old acquaintance of ours.

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,379
It visits frequently

00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,320
and seldom requires an invitation.

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,509
The parrot let out a soft whistle,

00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,389
then hopped twice on its perch.

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:35,940
Its beady eyes glimmered

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,480
with that same inexplicable intelligence

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,259
that had unsettled me earlier.

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,710
Horns leaned toward the cage,

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,879
observing the bird with a scientist's fascination

00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,539
mixed with the detector's sharp suspicion.

00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,240
Watson, do you recall the phrase

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,610
it spoke earlier?

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,120
Holmes, the sounds were so foreign to my ear

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,299
that I fear I could not replicate a single

00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:55,169
syllable.

00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,240
Just so. Yet the pattern of intonation

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,250
was unmistakably deliberate.

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,980
There is information

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,440
encoded there. Not a mere

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,620
mimicry, but a recounting.

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,240
And that is what

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
our adversary fears.

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,220
Holmes, surely you do not

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,549
believe the parrot actually witnessed a murder?

00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,179
Believe?

00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,679
No, Watson.

00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,740
..

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,450
Deduce?

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,529
Yes.

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,279
The bird is a recorder, an observer, a living phonograph of the bush.

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,069
If the chieftain died in its presence, whatever words were last spoken,

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:34,629
whatever argument transpired, those may be preserved in this creature's memory.

00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,930
Mr. Holmes, the chieftain's dying words were frantic.

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,500
He spoke of betrayal, of a secret hidden in plain sight.

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,100
I thought it the ramblings of a delirious man.

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,419
..

00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:52,180
Delirium may veil truth, Captain, but it does not negate it.

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,289
A sudden tapping at the window started Harrington,

00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:59,230
who leapt to his feet with the agitation of a man long pursued.

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,829
Holmes, however, merely gestured for quiet,

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,740
his expression sharpening like a blade being honed.

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,519
Watson, step slightly to the left.

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
Captain, do not approach the window.

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,940
..

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,579
Our guest below seems restless.

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,879
Forcing myself to steady my nerves, I shifted position.

00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,289
Holmes slipped silently to the curtain and parted it but a fraction.

00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:25,299
He observed for a long moment, then allowed the drape to fall back into place.

00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,320
Our lamppost friend is still at his post.

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,960
And now, accompanied by another, the situation escalates.

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,240
...

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,819
Holmes, are they merely watching or preparing?

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:45,960
Both. A man who watches too long will eventually act to justify his vigilance.

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
..

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Holmes, if they mean to retrieve the bird, then we must.

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,700
We shall do nothing hasty, Captain.

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,379
The game of pursuit and concealment is won.

00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,889
I prefer to play on my own terms.

00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,840
It was then that Kimboo suddenly erupted into a flurry of agitation,

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,150
wings thrashing against the bars of the cage.

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,940
The parrot's eyes darted widely about the room

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,060
as though sensing some unseen presence creeping closer.

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,230
Ah, the mood shifts.

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,279
Soup!

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,409
Holmes, what does this mean?

00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,740
It means, Watson, that Kimboo is accustomed to danger

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,700
and recognizes when it draws near.

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,059
I moved instinctively closer to Harrington

00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,829
who seemed ready to bolt at the slightest provocation.

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,019
Holmes, however, remained notably calm

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,650
as he crossed the room and extinguished the last lamp.

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,919
The chamber fell into near total darkness

00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,799
with only the faint shimmering glow of the street lamps

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,579
filtering through the fog outside.

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,470
Sink!

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,740
Gentlemen, stand still.

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,779
Allow your eyes to adjust.

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,899
A dark room is less inviting to trespassers

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,069
and far more revealing to those who know how to listen.

00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:56,380
Several dance minutes passed in silence,

00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,620
broken only by the occasional rustle of wings

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,279
as Kimbu shifted nervously.

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,210
Then from somewhere just beyond our door came the unmistakable sound of a quiet footfall.

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,139
Not the polite step of Mrs. Hudson, but the careful predatory tread of someone attempting to mask their presence.

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:16,779
My pulse quickened and I cast a glance toward Holmes, though the dimness rendered him little more than a silhouette.

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,059
..

00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,910
Watson, revolver ready, but do not fire unless absolutely necessary.

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,419
A wounded intruder answers more questions than a dead one.

00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:29,919
Understood, Holmes.

00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,299
Dear God, they've come for me.

00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,400
..

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,720
Silence, Captain. Your fear is louder than your voice.

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,100
..

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,029
The door latch gave a subtle metallic click.

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,509
Slow, deliberate, a gloved hand formed a shadow against the glass panel above the handle.

00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,580
Holmes moved like a phantom, placing himself to the side of the entryway, invisible to anyone entering.

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,599
Watson, the moment they cross the threshold, illuminates the room.

00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,080
Harrington, remain behind me.

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,279
...

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,920
Before I could reply, the intruder forced the door open.

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,420
A hooded figure slipped inside, his movements swift, practiced and utterly silent.

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,490
Another shadow loomed behind him, obscured in the corridor.

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,539
They scanned the darkness as though attempting to locate the cage.

00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,240
The bird, it must be here. Find it before he wakes.

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,170
I nearly laughed aloud at the absurdity of their assumption that Holmes would be asleep during such.

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,919
A moment, but I contained myself, waiting for the signal.

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,329
Hmm. Now, Watson. Hmm.

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,039
I started the gas lamp.

00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,759
The room erupted into sudden brightness and the intruder's recoil as though seared by its radiance.

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,200
Gone, one attempted to flee but Holmes seized him with astonishing speed, forcing him to the ground.

00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,490
Second intruder, the one from the corridor, made a desperate grab for the pallet's cage.

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,759
Stop. Step away from the bird.

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,039
Out of my way, doctor. The bird speaks death.

00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,000
..

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,240
Watson, restrain him.

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,580
him. I lunged forward, knocking the man off balance. He stumbled, overturning a side table

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,139
with a clash. Kimu shrieked violently, flapping its wings in terror. We cannot let the creature

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:12,850
live. It knows. It knows. Knows what, my good fellow? And whom does it incriminate?

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:19,860
You cannot make me speak. You cannot. Hones was already upon him, pinning his arm behind his back

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,220
with precise efficiency.

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,490
Harrington, trembling but determined,

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,889
stepped forward as though ready to assist.

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,259
Holmes, is he one of the traders?

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,759
I recognize the accent.

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,859
These men followed us in Africa.

00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,549
Indeed, Captain.

00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,899
Quite the persistent sort.

00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,000
Dow! I am Mew!

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,500
The first intruder struggled beneath Holmes' grip

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,930
but was firmly subdued.

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,659
The second glared at me with wild, fevered eyes

00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,659
that practically glowed with desperation.

00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:53,139
If the bird repeats the chieftain's final accusation, we are doomed. All of us.

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,240
.....

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,819
Fascinating. So the chieftain named his murderer, did he?

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:06,039
Never. I said nothing of the sort. I...

00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,380
On the contrary. You said quite enough.

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Holmes turned to me, his expression filled with that unmistakable spark of triumph.

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,799
triumph. Watson, I believe our case has found its first solid footing. Bind them securely.

00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,279
There is much to learn, and dawn will bring no shortage of revelations.

00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,600
..

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,490
And indeed, as I tied the intruders with my medical bandages, the sturdiest material at hand,

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,539
I could not help but feel that we had only scratched the surface of a far deeper and

00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,960
darker secret. Kimball groped softly from his cage, as though confirming the unsettling truth

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,929
that more danger yet lay ahead.

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,700
At the first dew of dawn crept through the fog like a timid intruder

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,599
seeking permission to enter Londo.

00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,699
And its pale light softened the outlines of Baker Street,

00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,779
dimly illuminating the aftermath of the previous night's chaos.

00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,819
Our two mysterious assailants sat bound to sturdy chairs

00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,240
in the corner of our sitting room,

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,509
glowering beneath their lowered brows.

00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,630
Captain Harrington paced near the hearth with restless energy,

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,740
lancing periodically at the parrot's cage

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,559
as though expecting it to erupt into further calamity.

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,980
Holmes, in stark contrast to all of us, appeared invigorated.

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,619
The night's events had clearly sharpened his intellect,

00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,409
like the whetstone that awakens a dormant blade.

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,829
Watson, kindly pour yourself a cup of coffee.

00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,329
You appear as though sleep has become a stranger to you.

00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:30,650
Holmes, after wrestling ruffians, guarding exotic birds,

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,420
and anticipating further danger, I must say rest did not come easily.

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,460
..

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,380
Nonsense, Watson. You performed admirably.

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:46,670
A lesser man might have fainted during last night's excitement, yet here you stand, only slightly bedraggled.

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,740
I appreciate the compliment, though I suspect it is delivered with your customary irony.

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:58,380
Not at all. Even iron gates require hinges. You keep our endeavours balanced.

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,480
Harrington approached Holmes with a determined expression, his military posture stiff or tinged with vulnerability.

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,420
Mr. Holmes, we must question them.

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Surely they will reveal who sent them

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,779
and what they seek to prevent the world from learning.

00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,529
Patience, Captain.

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,480
A hurried interrogation yields tangled answers.

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,740
A careful one unravels truth.

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,660
..

00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,579
The parrot, Kimboo, voiced the sharp squawk,

00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:27,660
a sound halfway between alarm and impatience

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,090
as though objecting to the delay of its own tale.

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,480
Holmes turned toward the cage

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,210
with the air of a conductor addressing his soloist.

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,369
Kim Boo has a part to play, but its performance must be properly orchestrated.

00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:43,360
Holmes crossed to the corner where the two captives remained.

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,690
He studied their faces, rough, weather-beaten, and marked with the unmistakable signs of colonial hardship.

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,659
Their clothing bore traces of red dust, and one man's boots betrayed recent exposure to African soil.

00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,980
Gentlemen, you arrived in London less than a week ago.

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:05,079
judging from your attire and the distinctive dust on your boots dust native to the region

00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:12,180
near the Volta river basin you were very recently on the gold coast you know nothing detective

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:20,859
you cannot prove where we come from I do not prove I deduce and deduction requires only what

00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:27,400
is evident to any man with eyes and intellect in equal proportion unfortunately you appear in

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,650
in short supply of both.

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,860
I could not suppress a small smile.

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,000
Holmes delivered such barbs with a precision

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,179
that rivaled his vai.

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:34,610
Hmm.

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,340
Or Lin Bao.

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,960
Hmm.

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,510
Now, let us discuss matters plainly.

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,710
We will say nothing.

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,860
Nothing at all.

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,570
You already have.

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,150
Last night, in your desperation,

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,929
you uttered the most damning clue of all,

00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,000
that the parrot knows the truth of a murder.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,140
I require no confession from you.

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,110
The bird speaks nonsense, nonsense and curses.

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,909
Curses? No. Linguistic fragments of a dying tongue? Quite possibly.

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,630
Holmes moved to his desk and retrieved a thick leather-bound volume,

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,200
a dictionary of regional Africa, and dialects,

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,179
the hassle of which he had apparently studied with great interest over the years.

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,659
Harrington looked astonished.

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,789
Holmes, I had no idea you were so familiar with those languages.

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,030
A detective never knows which tongue might whisper the final clue.

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,680
Watson, bring the cage closer.

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,070
I lifted Kimbu's cage with care,

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,529
though the bird's sharp gaze made me feel as though I were being judged for every movement.

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,090
As I positioned the cage on the table before Holmes,

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,960
Kimbu ruffled his feathers with a haughty sort of dignity.

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,549
Now then, Kimbu, let us hear what you have stored away.

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,759
Holmes tapped lightly on the cage.

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,259
Kimbu straightened and uttered a low, rhythmic phrase,

00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,130
the same guttural sequence we had heard the previous day,

00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,289
though now with more force and urgency.

00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,650
Holmes repeated the sounds under his breath,

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,730
comparing them to the entries in the dictionary.

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,299
Watson, listen closely.

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,319
..

00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,869
These syllables correspond to a dialect used in the northern territories,

00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,839
rarely spoken outside certain chieftain plans.

00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,559
..

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,519
Can you translate it, Holmes?

00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,869
Almost.

00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,859
The phrase is fragmented, but the structure is unmistakable.

00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:27,099
It sounds like he who comes with white hands brings death

00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,380
Or possibly the white-handed man kills the chief

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,440
..

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
White-handed? You mean a foreigner? A European?

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,819
..

00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:38,619
Precisely

00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,579
And the phrase is repeated with remarkable consistency

00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:46,480
Suggesting it was spoken at a moment of urgency

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,269
Likely during or immediately before the chieftain's death

00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,299
Lies! The bird lies! Parrots do not know truth.

00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:56,460
..

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,639
Parrots know what they hear, and they repeat what haunts them.

00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:08,380
This bird was present during the murder or, at the very least, near enough to hear the accusation.

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,480
Holmes leaned closer to the captives. For a moment, silence stretched thin and taut across the room like the string of Holmes's violin.

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,329
Tell me, who among the colonial traders is known by the name White Hand?

00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:25,779
A nickname perhaps? A moniker used by locals?

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,920
..

00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,880
We, we know no such man.

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,799
Another lie. Your reaction is too swift, too rehearsed.

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,940
I will ask again, who bears that name?

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,660
You think us fools, detective? You think we will betray our employers so easily?

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,039
I do not require your cooperation. The evidence will reveal itself in due course.

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,420
..

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,940
Holmes returned to the parrot and tapped the cage again.

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,110
Kimbo repeated the phrase, then added another set of syllables I had not heard before.

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,410
Harsher, more clipped, delivered with a strange trembling of the bird's wings.

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,079
Ah, there is more, there is more.

00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,839
The second phrase, yes, it resembles the local word for ivory and perhaps river.

00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:17,119
hand betrayal homes could he be naming a location a route more likely describing

00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,799
an illicit trade operation one that someone wished to keep hidden perhaps

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,900
even from the chieftain himself the captive stiffened confirming Holmes's

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,440
suspicion without uttering a single word Holmes observed them with the detached

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,920
calm of a surgeon watching involuntary reflexes there it is your guilt betrays

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,480
You understand nothing of the politics of the Gold Coast, Detective. Nothing.

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:53,720
On the contrary. I understand that greed knows no language barriers and murder recognizes no borders.

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,900
Combats. Just then, Mrs. Hudson entered, clutching her telegram in her flustered hands.

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,640
Mr. Holmes, this arrived for you just now. The boy said it came from the foreign office. Urgent.

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,730
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,509
Holmes snapped open the telegram with swift fingers, scanned its contents,

00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,759
and his expression hardened like wet clay left in the sun.

00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,859
Gentlemen, we have confirmation.

00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:18,980
..

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,809
The Foreign Office reports that a lieutenant, Colonel Rupert Ashcombe,

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:30,779
known among the locals as the White Hand, arrived in London two days before Captain Harrington.

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,610
He is wanted for questioning in connection with unauthorized ivory operations.

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,550
Ashcombe. Impossible. He was respected. Decorated.

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,019
Decorations have often concealed darker stains.

00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:46,279
..

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,559
It appears we now know the identity of the man our intruders serve.

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,660
..

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,680
You know nothing. You cannot reach him. He is protected.

00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
..

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,590
Protected, perhaps, but not invisible, and certainly not innocent.

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,860
The parrot screeched loudly, hobbing back and forth on its perch.

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,639
And you!

00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:10,880
As though urging us to move without delay, Holmes stroked his chin thoughtfully.

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,079
And that's la, fully...

00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,610
Watson, Hannington, prepare yourselves.

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,579
The time has come to confront Lieutenant Colonel Ashcombe.

00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:24,920
The final act of this drama will not unfold here in Baker Street.

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,620
...

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,920
No, it will unfold wherever Ashcombe hides his secrets.

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,740
And though I could not yet foresee the dangers awaiting us,

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,289
I felt the unmistakable thrill of the chase warming my blood.

00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:44,210
The mystery had deepened, and Holmes, with the parrot Kimboo as our unlikely guide,

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,840
was ready to pursue its darkest thread.

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,000
London's midday fog had thinned by the time we reached Blattfriars Wharf,

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,480
yet a chill wind swept across the river with the insistence of an unwelcome reminder

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,599
that danger lingered close. Holmes strode ahead of Captain Harrington and myself

00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,539
with purposeful haste, his long coat billowing like a banner heralding the charge of a lone

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,940
general. Himmu, the African parrot, accompanied us within a larger travel gauge, pursed indignantly

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,250
and occasionally muttering the ominous fragments it had recited in Baker Street.

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,440
That creature's uncanny repetition felt increasingly like the refrain of a prophecy,

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,910
drawing us nearer to its fulfillment.

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,700
Watson, keep a sharp eye on our surroundings.

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,610
Ashkund is not the sort to sit idly when his schemes are threatened.

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,599
Holmes, I dare say that after last night's encounter,

00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,000
I am unlikely to miss even the rustling of a rat.

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,019
Even rats can be deceiving, Watson.

00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:43,059
Many a villain is passed unnoticed

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:49,039
because he disguised himself less as a predator and more as a pest.

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,400
Harrington carried the cage with both hands, his military bearing stiffened with anxiety.

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,429
Mr. Holmes, are you certain Ashkoomba is here?

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,720
The foreign officer said he was staying at a club near Whitehall.

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,780
..

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:08,119
Men whose hands are stained with betrayal seldom linger in respectable places.

00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,659
Trust me, Captain, the docks conceal more truth than London's parlours ever will.

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:19,360
The wharf was a sprawling mess of crates, tar-stained ropes and the pungent scent of the thimbs.

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,880
Labourers shouted, pulleys droned, gulls circled overhead with shrill cries,

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,329
the kind of commotion in which a fugitive might vanish entirely,

00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:30,069
or from which an ambush might easily spring.

00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:34,130
There, the warehouse marked with the ivory emblem.

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,059
Discretion was never Ashcombe's strong suit.

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,220
..

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,820
Holmes pointed toward a large structure of soot-blackened brick.

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,420
Its faded signage depicted a tusk-like shape partially obscured by grime,

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,469
even from a distance. A sense of illicit secrecy emanated from it.

00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:54,700
Harrington's jaw tightened as the sight stirred some painful recognition.

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,619
That symbol, Holmes, Holmes. That's the mark used by the traders suspected of smuggling ivory

00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:04,579
along the Volta. I encountered it years ago during an inquiry.

00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,179
..

00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:12,200
Precisely. Ashcombe believes himself clever, but his confidence is merely arrogance in disguise.

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,279
guys. The three of us approached cautiously. The warehouse doors were ajar, allowing a thin

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,640
beam of sunlight to pierce the otherwise murky interior. Combs motioned for silence as he stepped

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,389
inside. I followed, revolver in hand, while Harrington drawed the cage with measured steps.

00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:31,119
Watson, remain alert. If Ashcombe is here, he will not greet us with hospitality.

00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,220
..

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,359
The interior of the warehouse was dim, with rows of crates stacked like the rows of some crude

00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,319
cathedral lit only by flickering shafts of dusty light. The air carried the bitter smell of

00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,679
preservatives, wood shalings and something else, something metallic, though faint.

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:53,829
Holmes, do you smell that? It's iron. Blood, Watson. Very faint, but unmistakable.

00:29:53,829 --> 00:30:01,299
Blood? Whose blood? Possibly the blood of anyone who has gotten too close to Ashkum's secrets.

00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,019
...

00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,440
As the horn queued, a soft clatter echoed in the far corner,

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,710
followed by the scurrying of hurried footsteps.

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,139
Holmes dashed forward with feline spiffness,

00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:17,490
brushing aside a crate and revealing a narrow passageway leading deeper into the warehouse.

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,730
Come, the quarry flees.

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,259
We pursued him into a low-lit corridor lined with more crates,

00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,199
some marked with official stamps,

00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,640
others bearing illicit symbols of trade networks.

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,650
works, Harrington nearly tripped on a discarded length of rope but recovered quickly.

00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,400
Holmes, the markings. Some of these grades came directly from Ashanti territories.

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,019
..

00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,260
Precisely why Ashkoon cannot allow us to leave?

00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,720
Suddenly, a voice rang out from the shadows ahead, smooth, commanding,

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,049
tinged with the confidence of a man accustomed to unquestioned authority.

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:55,099
Mr. Holmes, you have a talent for meddling where your presence is neither wanted nor wise.

00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:03,929
A figure emerged from behind a crate, tall, impeccably dressed, with silvering temples and a cold smile that suggested both charm and cruelty.

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:13,720
His boots bore the same red dust stains Holmes had previously noted, a telltale sign of recent travel to the very African territories at the heart of this affair.

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:21,980
Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Ashcombe, or rather the White Hand, as you are known to those whose trust you exploited.

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,880
A childish nickname by superstitious natives, nothing more.

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,900
On the contrary, it is a title earned and won.

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,960
The chieftain spoke as he lay dying.

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,980
..

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,809
Nonsense! You cannot expect me to tremble before the ravings of a dying man.

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,070
Kimu, as though recognizing the man's voice with instinctive dread,

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,000
had flapped violently within the cage, shrieking its haunting phrase.

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,389
Harrington struggled to maintain his grip.

00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,519
Holmes, the bird, it's terrified of him.

00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,420
An honest witness will often display more courage than a deceitful man.

00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,740
..

00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,200
Holmes, I invite you to leave immediately. That verdict was never meant to survive.

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,470
As Ashcombe stepped closer, I noticed the glint of a revolver conceded beneath his coat, its barrel catching a sliver of light.

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,420
Watson, to your left. He's reaching for the weapon.

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,750
Before I could react, Ashcombe drew the revolver and fired.

00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:20,329
The shot rang out with deafening force, splintering a crate inches from my head.

00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:23,000
Holmes, he means to kill us.

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,450
Watson, flank him.

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,170
Ashcombe, for God's sake, stand down.

00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,610
Oh, I warned you, Harrington. Some secrets are worth any price.

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,869
Holmes leapt sideways with remarkable agility, closing the distance between himself and Ashcombe.

00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:41,710
Another shot fired, ricocheting dangerously close to Harrington.

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,759
Kimbu screeched with such ferocity that the warehouse seemed to echo with the chieftain's dying accusation.

00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,760
..

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,269
Watson, now.

00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:53,389
I lunged forward, grabbing Ashkum's weapon hand and wrenching it aside.

00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:58,529
The revolver discharged a final time, the bullet embedding itself harmlessly in the wooden floor.

00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:04,920
Though Ashkum fought with surprising strength, delivering a brutal blow to my ribs that sent me stumbling backward.

00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,440
You fools! You have no idea what this bird knows.

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,970
On the contrary, Ashkum, I know precisely what it knows.

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,759
Holmes seized Ashkum's arm with expert precision,

00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,240
whisking it until the revolver clattered to the ground.

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,230
The colonel droned in pain but continued to struggle.

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,650
Harrington dropped the cage and rushed to assist, tackling Ashkum around the waist.

00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,960
You murdered him. You murdered the chieftain.

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,000
..

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,799
He would have exposed everything. I had no choice.

00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,059
..

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:39,659
There is always a choice. Yours was greed and the blood of an innocent man stains your hands.

00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,119
With combined effort, we pinned Ashkum to the ground.

00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,150
Hong secured his arms behind his back with a length of rope scavenged from a nearby crate.

00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:54,750
The defeated Colonel lay gasping, his once imperious expression replaced by the hollow gaze of a man whose empire had crumbled.

00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,970
Holmes, if you only knew what fortune lies in those crates, what power!

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,920
Fortune built upon suffering is no fortune at all. It is theft and murder.

00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,940
..

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:13,059
Kimball, trembling but alive, spoke again in its guttural dialect, the chieftain's dying words reverberating through the warehouse with haunting authority.

00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:15,239
The final phrase rang out like a verdict.

00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,190
There, Watson, the bird delivers its testimony.

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,420
Holmes, thank you. I thought this darkness would follow me to the grave.

00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:28,039
Justice may travel slowly, Captain, but it arrives eventually.

00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,550
Holmes stood, straightened his coat, and glanced down at Ashcombe with a final, measured gaze.

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:39,860
Watson, alert, Inspector Lestrade, and ensure the Foreign Office receives a detailed account.

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:47,619
count. This warehouse is a trove of evidence, enough to unravel the entire ivory conspiracy.

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,960
..

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,039
At one's homes. And have someone collect this courageous bird. Kimbo has honoured the memory

00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,599
of its master with remarkable fidelity. Zee stepped into the light of the now

00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,840
bustling wharf. I felt the palpable weight of the morning settle into my bones. Fatigue,

00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,219
relief and the unmistakable awe that always followed, one of Holmes' triumphs.

00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,989
The case was far from concluded in the courts, but the truth had been unveiled,

00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:18,409
and Kimbu, perched proudly now, seemed almost triumphant.

00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:23,699
The fog had returned by the time Holmes and I left Blackfriars Wharf with Ashcombe safely in

00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:30,159
Lestrade. Hmm, ease custody. Hmm, yet I felt as though a different fog, that of disbelief and

00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,220
and lingering dread still clung stubbornly wide to the morning's events.

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Holmes seemed invigorated rather than exhausted,

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,400
and his sharp stride along the embankment

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,409
betrayed a mind still racing through layers of deduction and consequence.

00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,539
Imbo, now returned to a cupboard carrier,

00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,699
made occasional soft chirps that contrasted sharply

00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,489
with the anguished cries it had uttered in the warehouse.

00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:55,840
It seemed calmer, as though the shadow looming over its memory had been lifted.

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,280
Watson, I trust your ribs are intact despite Ashcombe's less than gentle greeting?

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,460
..

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,470
Tender, but functional. I've suffered worse in service at my one.

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:13,519
Good. You'll need to be in full command of your faculties for the remainder of this matter.

00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,360
..

00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,550
Holmes, pray tell. What remains? Ashcombe is arrested. His smuggling operations will be dismantled.

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,940
The bird has fulfilled its remarkable purpose.

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:32,380
us. Hone stalked beneath a lamplight, a faint glow casting precise angles onto his hawk-like profile.

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:41,440
Come now, Watson, surely you do not believe that a man as calculating as Ashcombe operates without

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:51,000
contingencies? You suspect accomplices? Suspect? No, I am certain. The question is not whether

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,820
whether they exist but how deeply entwined they are with the Foreign Office and how eager

00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,359
they are to silence the final witness.

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,390
The witness?

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,300
You mean Kimboo?

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,579
..

00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:03,260
Precisely.

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:10,000
A parrot may not be able to provide a legal deposition in court, but its ability to mimic

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,810
the chieftain's dying confession renders it dangerously inconvenient to the guilty.

00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,539
Holmes, are you suggesting they are still being watched?

00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:28,239
Watson, I am suggesting we have been watched since the moment Kimbu first uttered the tribal accusation in Baker Street.

00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,300
..

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,579
Shiva crawled along my spine despite the thick wool of my coat.

00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,849
Holmes resumed his brisk pace and I struggled to keep up.

00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,309
We shall return to Baker Street. There we will set the final trap.

00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,000
The journey back was fraught with unease.

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,130
I found myself, checking each passing handsome cab, each shadow doorway,

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,250
imagining hidden enemies lurking within the very heartbeat of London streets.

00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,780
It was only once we reached the familiar cobblestones of Baker Street

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,719
that a semblance of safety returned, though Holmes seemed no more at ease than before.

00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,820
..

00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,369
Upstairs, Watson, and keep your revolver within reach.

00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,140
Holmes, is an attack truly imminent?

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,760
If my calculations are correct, the accomplice will arrive within the hour.

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,670
scope, but fear not, we shall be prepared.

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,860
Once inside our sitting room, Holmes instructed me to place the parrot's cage atop the table

00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,639
near the window. He then drew the curtains halfway, allowing only

00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,470
partial visibility of the room from outside. Watson,

00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,599
position yourself behind the lacquered screen. I shall assume

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,060
an attitude of contemplation here by the fireplace.

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,539
The intruder will aim for me first.

00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,819
Holmes, surely this is unnecessary. We could inform Lestrade.

00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:43,280
Tee-lo!

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,060
..

00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:53,159
Lestrade, my dear fellow, he's undoubtedly occupied cataloguing every illicit item within that warehouse.

00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:57,360
By the time he arrived, our adversary would have vanished,

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,000
leaving behind nothing but a broken window and a missing bird.

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
..

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,000
The Legdalli.

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,260
With reluctance, I hid behind the screen, revolver drawn.

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,960
on. Holmes sat in his armchair with casual poise, yet I could tell his senses were attuned to every

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,039
whisper and movement in the air. For many tense minutes, nothing occurred. Kimu shifted restlessly

00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,219
in its cage, tapping the wooden purge. Outside, a carriage clattered by. Then another. The clock

00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:26,850
on the mantoo chimed the quarter hour. Patience, Watson. The web is set.

00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:32,219
Suddenly, a faint scratching noise emanated from the window latch. Hum stiffened ever so slightly.

00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:33,400
I dare not read.

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,419
..

00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:35,869
The window lifted silently.

00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:41,400
A gloved hand appeared, followed by the silhouette of a figure clad in dark clothing and a mask.

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,269
The intruder moved with the position of a trained operative.

00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:47,680
Not a common thief, but someone accustomed to infiltration.

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,489
The bird. Where's the bird?

00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,690
Good evening. I believe you are seeking Kimbu.

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,579
Kohn spoke with such calm that the intruder momentarily froze.

00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,569
Then, with a swift lunge, the man produced a knife.

00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:02,579
Sherlock Holmes, you leave me no choice.

00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:03,919
..

00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:07,699
Before he could reach Holmes, I emerged from hiding, revolver raised.

00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,809
Drop the weapon this instant.

00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,230
Another step and the bird dies.

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,449
You overestimate your advantage, sir.

00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:19,789
You see, you have made three critical errors already.

00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,619
What are you talking about?

00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,659
..

00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:26,039
First, you approached the window without checking the street.

00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,150
Which informed me you act under time constraints.

00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,380
Second, your boots carry residue of red dyed laterite clay.

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,840
The same we found in Ashcombe's warehouse but mixed with London soot.

00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,750
Meaning you have visited that location today.

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,940
And third...

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,010
Tones' hand shot out, knocking the knife from the intruder's draught with surgical precision.

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,340
The robe staggered backward, stunned.

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:59,250
You failed to anticipate that Watson's sense of duty rarely allows him to miss an opportunity to S.

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,440
Hmm. Ave my life. Hmm.

00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,700
..

00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,970
I moved swiftly and pressed the revolver to the intruder's chest.

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,480
Surrender now. You are outmatched.

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,600
..

00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,930
You fools have no idea who I serve.

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,519
On the contrary, I know exactly who you serve.

00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:25,650
The emblem sewn into your cuff, partially torn yet still visible, is from a private regiment operated under Ashcombe's patronage.

00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,840
You are the lieutenant he appointed to oversee the smuggling shipments.

00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,019
Holmes, you should never have interfered.

00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:39,639
And you should never have underestimated the consequences of murdering an African chieftain.

00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:42,099
...

00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,820
They drew a lunge suddenly, attempting to break past me, but Holmes intercepted him.

00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,380
With a swift blow to the temple, the masked man collapsed to the floor, unconscious.

00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:57,320
A most inelegant attempt. Watson, if you would be so kind as to restrain him.

00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,740
...

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,219
I bound the man's wrists while Holmes retrieved the fallen knife, examining it with clinical detail.

00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:12,130
A ceremonial dagger, a shanty in design but crudely modified for stealth.

00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,779
This confirms he sought not merely to silence the bird,

00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:22,420
but to steal an artifact that might incriminate the entire network.

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,820
..

00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,000
Holmes, is the danger finally past?

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,219
Yes, Watson. The final accomplice has revealed himself.

00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:37,389
With Ashcombe in custody and his lieutenant apprehended, the conspiracy is broken.

00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:41,590
Kimball chirped, then repeated the chieftain's final words once more.

00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,489
But this time, the tone sounded almost peaceful.

00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,779
The burden of its memory seemed at last to lift.

00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:52,530
Watson, observe the creature carefully. You may learn something.

00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,360
Holmes, what lesson could I possibly glean from a parrot?

00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:03,260
it. The virtue of unwavering truth, even when reduced to mimicry, the bird never altered a

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,860
single syllable of its testimony. Many humans could aspire to such honesty. You surprise me

00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:17,859
with your sentiment. Nonsense. I speak only of the facts. Arrington arrived, shoddy thereafter,

00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:22,739
breathless from the haste with which he had come, when he saw the bound intruder on our floor and

00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,190
and Kimbu unharmed, his shoulders sad with profound relief.

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,730
Holmes, I cannot thank you enough.

00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,480
You have avenged the chieftain.

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,760
His memory, it will not be lost.

00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,820
..

00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,460
Ensure the proper authorities handle the aftermath

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,119
and see that Kimbu is returned to those who cherished him.

00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,340
Of course, the tribe will want to honor him for his service.

00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,419
..

00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,960
After the intruder was taken away and Harrington departed with solemn gratitude,

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,149
Holmes finally allowed himself to relax.

00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:54,720
He settled into his armchair,

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,359
steepling his fingers as he gazed into the fire.

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,650
Holmes, must every case end with such peril?

00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,019
Peril, Watson, is merely the cost of confronting the truth.

00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:09,900
But I dare say this particular case possessed a curious charm.

00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,000
..

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,590
Charm? Holmes, we were nearly killed.

00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,860
Ah, yes, but consider the intellectual elegance.

00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,409
A parrot bearing the dying words of a murdered chieftain.

00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:28,569
A conspiracy unraveled through logic, observation and an avian witness.

00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:34,539
Few detectives can claim such unusual companions in the pursuit of justice.

00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,660
..

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,519
Holmes, only you would raise a case for its oddity.

00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,230
My dear Watson, oddity is often the hallmark of truth.

00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,760
The world disguises its crimes in conventional clothing.

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,039
building, when something appears unique, that is when one should look most closely.

00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,860
I sat opposite him, watching the fire flicker against the familiar clutter of our sitting

00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,140
room, the chemical vials, the scattered monographs, the violin resting quietly atop its table.

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,989
Peace had returned, yet the memory of the day's dangers hummed softly beneath my skin.

00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,980
Combs, what shall I record as the moral of this adventure?

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:15,780
chirp. Record that even the smallest voice, even the echo of a voice, can topple an empire built

00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:25,179
upon dirt. See it. Kimbo let out a final chirp, turning its head as though acknowledging the

00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:30,029
great detective's words. And for a moment, as the warm dew of the hearth washed over us,

00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:34,900
I felt an uncommon tranquility. The case had begun with a cry of death from a distant land,

00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,659
and ended with justice restored,

00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:38,239
carried upon the wings of a creature

00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,050
whose loyalty transcended kingdoms.

00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,670
I opened my journal,

00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,579
inked my pen

00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:44,289
and began to write the final lines.

00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:45,420
Holmes washed me,

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,949
a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips.

00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:48,720
Sir!

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,380
Do describe me generously, Watson.

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,019
The public must have its hero.

00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,619
Holmes, you require no embellishment.

00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,059
Your deeds speak plainly enough.

00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,579
Then let us rest, Watson.

00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:02,380
Tomorrow,

00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,719
Tomorrow London will present new mysteries, and I dare say we shall need all our wits.

00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:17,099
..........
