00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
It was a calm morning when I found myself once again in the company of my friend Sherlock Holmes,

00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,640
that extraordinary consulting detective whose life and work had often overshadowed my own profession as a medical man.

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,500
As usual, he was restless while I attempted to enjoy the tranquility afforded by our sitting room in Baker Street.

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,359
Look, Watson, out there across the rooftops, the frost clings like lace.

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,120
And yet you bury yourself in the dull columns of that newspaper.

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,420
My dear Holmes, some men find as much adventure in the morning news

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,590
as you find in a muddy footprint upon the pavement.

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,120
Adventure, Watson, is not printed in ink.

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,289
It is written in dust upon boots, in the tremor of a hand as it seals a letter,

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,240
or in the curious case that knocks at our door.

00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,280
..

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,320
You speak as if you expect a case this very morning.

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,880
Expect? No. Observe? Yes.

00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,950
Footsteps ascended our stair only moments ago.

00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,920
deliberate yet halting a visitor stands now upon our threshold uncertain whether to knock

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,359
gentlemen forgive the intrusion i am in need of your counsel mr holmes break come in sir the fire

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,239
is warm and mr do and mr upward holmes has been expecting you in a manner of speaking

00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,519
..

00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:25,719
indeed sir you have walked from the northern districts over the bridge they called casper

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,719
And you come with more upon your conscience than frost upon your boots.

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,959
..

00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,639
Startled, how on earth could you know such a thing?

00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:39,590
Aside, narrating, here once again I saw my friend's extraordinary powers at play.

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,099
Deductions drawn from signs invisible to my untrained eye.

00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,659
Les amis and more no one here as les amis fears this to see what he saw.

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,460
Your boots, sir, still damp with viver mist.

00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:57,680
the clay upon their edges is peculiar to the banks near Casper Bridge. Furthermore,

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,199
your right glove is missing a button, and the anxiety with which you twisted

00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:08,250
betrays an urgent matter weighing upon your mind. But come, enough of this display.

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,019
Take a seat, and tell us what clouds your spirit.

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,000
My name is Edward Mason. It is not my own safety I fear, but that of a woman.

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,379
She has vanished near Casper Bridge, and the police dismiss it as hysteria.

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,780
But I know she's in peril.

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,120
..

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Vanished, you say?

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,920
Pray give us the particulars.

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,689
She is Clara Whitfield,

00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,409
governess to my sister's children.

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,250
At three nights past,

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,039
she crossed Casper Bridge

00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,949
to return to her lodgings,

00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:31,800
but never arrived.

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,490
All that was found was her scarf,

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,449
caught on the railings above the water.

00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:38,310
A scarf by itself proves nothing.

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,639
Did she have enemies?

00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,819
..

00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,389
Deaths, suitors,

00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:43,900
who might wish her harm?

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,939
..

00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,589
None that I know of, Mr. Holmes.

00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:47,859
She was gentle, quiet,

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,200
much loved by the children, but lately she seemed troubled, startled by shadows, pale

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,100
as if pursued by some secret fear.

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,980
The Holmes this has the scent of something dark.

00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
Indeed, Watson.

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,040
Mr. Mason, we shall visit this bridge and the young woman's lodgings.

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,800
But first I should like to see the scarf.

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Produce his item from his coat-pocket.

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Here, sir.

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
It is still damp with river mist.

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Ha!

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:22,480
Note, Watson, the faint trace of perfume upon this phadric, yet beneath it a darker stain, blood, though partially washed away by the river, elementary.

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,720
Uncle, with awe, you see such things where I perceive nothing.

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,520
You perceive, Watson, but you do not observe.

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,470
Therein lies all the difference.

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,840
But come, Mr. Mason, we go at once to Casper Bridge.

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,580
By midday, we had crossed into the northern districts of London,

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,220
the fog clung to the riverbanks,

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,269
and the great arc of Casper Bridge loomed before us.

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,680
It was here, amid the shifting currents

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,420
and the creak of wagon wheels upon the stone span,

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,030
that the case drew us deeper into shadow.

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,870
Note, Watson, the marks upon the stone where the scarf was caught.

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,280
Do you see how the fibres are frayed,

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,740
not merely by wind, but by a violent tug?

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,960
By Jove, Holmes, so they are.

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,110
and here I see something glistening upon the stone.

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,640
Could it be blood?

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
Precisely, Watson.

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,420
A smear, thin yet undeniable.

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,110
She straddled here,

00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,939
perhaps dragged or forced against the railing.

00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,420
The river was not her chosen grave.

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,120
It was an attempt at concealment.

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,180
Boy is trembling, when she yet may live.

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,240
..

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,060
That, Mr. Mason, depends upon the swiftness of our pursuit

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,620
and the cunning of her assailant.

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,430
Come, let us face the footprints leading off the bridge.

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,679
Note their irregular spacing.

00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:45,439
A man half dragging, half carrying, a burden heavier than himself.

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,090
Aside, narrating.

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,430
Thus began our strange pursuit across the cobbles of London,

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,399
following the faintest impressions upon damp stone,

00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,949
impressions only Holmes could read.

00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,230
With such clarity, my heart quickened,

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,199
for I knew then that we were upon the trail of a mystery

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,340
whose darkness lay just beyond the veil of this fog.

00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:08,209
No chain bamp in, goes the tray from Casper Bridge, faint as it was,

00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:13,239
led us northward through winding lanes until we reached the narrow street where Clara Whitfield resided.

00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,769
It was there, amid the worn facades and the scent of coal smoke,

00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:20,539
that Holmes resolved to search for the young woman's presence or her absence.

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,599
..

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,079
Observe, Watson, the absence of order in this establishment.

00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,219
..

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,500
It mirrors the turmoil of its inhabitants.

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:38,680
Gentlemen, you seek Miss Whitfield? Poor soul, she has not been seen since that dreadful night.

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,779
..

00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,639
We are here at the request of Mr. Edward Mason. Permit us to view her room, madam.

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,920
..

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Very well, sir, but it chills me to open that door.

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,300
She left it locked behind her, and yet, when I entered the air to she's, things were not as she had left them.

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,319
..

00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,930
Precisely what we must see. Lead on, if you please.

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,240
Narrating, we ascended to the third floor, where the narrow corridor grew colder and dimmer.

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,730
The landlady unlocked the chamber door, and Holmes entered at once,

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,800
his sharp eyes darting from shadow to shadow.

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,839
..

00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,060
Note, Watson, the bed covering creased at the edge, as though by a hurried departure.

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,580
And here, on the writing desk, scraps of torn paper.

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,120
They appear to be from a litter, but the ink is smeared as though moistened by tears of water.

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,930
A careful hand can reconstruct the words.

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,960
Bridge danger, trust no one.

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,180
Do you see?

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,430
The message was hurried, yet deliberate.

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,800
She anticipated peril.

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,470
Then she knew she was pursued.

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,199
Holmes, what villain dared menace her?

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,319
..

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,149
That, sir, is what we must uncover.

00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,060
Tell me, landlady, who last called upon Miss Whitfield?

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,250
Only a gentleman.

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,210
A tall figure, well-dressed, though his manner was harsh.

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,740
He pressed her with questions, and she seemed frightened.

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,889
I thought him her uncle.

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,639
Did he give his name?

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,379
He signed the register as Mr. Harland.

00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,200
But I mistrust it.

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,060
It was written with a heavy flourish, unlike a true name.

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:24,160
Farland, curious, a false name, likely chosen to mislead

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,920
And here, Watson, observe beneath the carpet a scrap of dark cloth

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,319
It is coarse wool, torn from a man's overcoat

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,939
There are also small drains of sand embedded within

00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,120
Just so, sand not of London's streets, but of the villa bank

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,819
Casper Bridge once more calls to us

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,829
The villain tracked her here and lightly dragged her hence.

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,689
Then she was abducted from her very room. Heaven help her.

00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:56,250
Bones, do you suppose this Harlan sought to silence her, fearing what she knew?

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,310
An excellent hypothesis, my dear Watson.

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,300
You are learning.

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,240
Observe also the open window latch, though closed now.

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,730
It bears scratches from recent forcing.

00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,149
She did not depart of her own will.

00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,539
By heaven, the villain carried her out into the night.

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:20,269
Not quite. See these faint impressions on the silchock dust common to warehouse floors.

00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:28,259
I deduce she was carried not into the street, but through a rear passage that leads to the wards.

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,909
Then the warehouses conceal her captors. We must hasten there at once.

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,579
Holmes, shall we call upon the constabulary?

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,100
No, Watson.

00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,600
Hmm. Hint. Oh.

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,620
The police, with their blundering zeal, would only frighten the villains into deeper concealment.

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,640
Subtlety is our ally.

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,000
Tonight, when fog thickens, we shall visit these warehouses.

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
..

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,180
God preserve you, gentlemen.

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,970
That district is a haunt of rogues and smugglers.

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,100
Beware, for none return unscathed.

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,600
..

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,160
Narrating.

00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,439
Thus did we glean the clues from Clara Whitfield's chamber fragments of warning,

00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:10,279
pounded cloth, the trace of chalk and sand,

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,289
and as evening shadows lengthened, I felt the chill of foreboding,

00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,719
knowing that our next steps would lead us into the heart of London's darkness.

00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,759
..

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,419
Come, Watson, there is no time to waste.

00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:24,089
Tonight we move from observation to action.

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,399
Dossied Holmes, as always.

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,819
Hildning fell upon London like a shroud,

00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,039
the fog rising from the river thick as wool.

00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,619
Holmes led us toward the warehouses that lined the northern bank,

00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,370
their looming shapes half-swallowed in shadow.

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,079
It was there, he insisted, that the fate of Clara Whitfield awaited discovery.

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,269
Observe, Watson, the lantern glow within yonder warehouse.

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,869
That, I think, is our destination.

00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,470
But how shall we enter without alerting them?

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,149
Subtlety, Mr. Mason.

00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,659
The river offers concealment where doors will not.

00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,829
Watson, do you note the planks leading to the side dock?

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,000
I see them, warped and slippery, yet serviceable

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,419
Do you mean to approach by the rear?

00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,500
..

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,319
Precisely, follow quietly

00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,579
Sound is our enemy tonight

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,120
Narrating, we crept along the dam boards

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,740
The river lapping beneath our feet

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,819
My heart thudded with each cautious step

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,079
Fearful that one misstep would betray us

00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,379
Holmes, by contrast, moved with the precision of a shadow

00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,539
Colt, do you hear it?

00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,970
The murmur of voices within?

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,179
Yes, two men speaking harshly.

00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,539
One curses, the other urges silence.

00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,109
Let us confirm.

00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,849
Here is a crack in the shutter.

00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,689
Clear through Watson and tell me what you see.

00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,730
Fearing? By heavens!

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,139
There, Clara Whitfield bound to a chair,

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,740
her face pale but alive.

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,109
And beside her, two ruffians,

00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,559
one taut with a scarred cheek,

00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,029
the other shorter, pacing like a hound.

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,599
Clara, she lives. We must rush them at once.

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,519
Hush, man. Your zeal would undo us. Action must be precise, not reckless.

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,980
Holmes, what do you propose?

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,040
..

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,549
A diversion, Watson. You shall circle to the front and draw their attention with a firm knock.

00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:15,059
Mason and I will enter from behind, where the knock is weakest.

00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,710
A perilous plan, but I trust you.

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,580
Um, and I, hmm.

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,860
Your task is silence. Follow me, but do not speak unless bidden.

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,220
Narrating, thus we parted, Holmes and Mason to the shadows at the rear, I to the fore.

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,580
My heart thundered as I approached the heavy doors, lifted my stick, and rapped thrice.

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,470
Who goes there? Blasted! Who knocks at this hour?

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,230
A lost passerby, sir, seeking directions in the fog.

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,279
Pool, send him off. We cannot be discovered.

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,480
Bursting in from rear. Now, Watson, strike true.

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,520
..

00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,600
Joining for Clara. Unhand the villains.

00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,620
..

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,940
Gnarling a trap. Two arms, Ned.

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,390
Move. Not so fast.

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,830
Striking down you go.

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,450
Clara, hold on.

00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,170
Edward, oh thank heaven.

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,020
Watson, secure the shorter man.

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,360
The constable shall find two prizes this night.

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
Already done, Holmes

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
He will not stir soon

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,379
To scard villain

00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,720
And you, sir, shall answer for your cruelty

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,019
You lured the lady with threats

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,820
Sought to silence her knowledge of your smuggling enterprise

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,500
And chose Casper Bridge as the place of terror

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,259
But your carelessness betrayed you

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,080
Sand on your coat, chalk on the sill

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,879
And the stain of blood upon her scarf

00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,060
Elementary

00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,059
inventory.

00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,059
Hm.

00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,739
Curse you, Holmes.

00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,459
Holmes, you have done it again.

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,119
Not I, Watson, the evidence.

00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,259
I merely followed where it led.

00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,939
You saved me, Mr. Holmes.

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:01,659
I shall never forget.

00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,179
Nor shall I.

00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,500
My family owes you a debt beyond words.

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,559
Ah, narrating, thus ended the adventure of Caspel Bridge, with the lady restored, the

00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,859
villains captured, and Holmes once more triumphant.

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,629
as we stepped into the fog-laden night,

00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,490
I could not help but marvel at the subtle chain of cues,

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,240
cues that I, though present,

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,210
might never have seen without my friend's unerring eye.

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,960
Come, Watson, another case awaits,

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,560
and the game, as always, is afoot.

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,779
.
