00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
It was one of those grey London mornings when the city lay under a shroud of fog

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,150
and the air carried that peculiar stillness which precedes the stir of human life.

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,789
Holmes and I had been in a rare season of quietude,

00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:15,960
though such peace never lasts long when one shares quarters with the world's only consulting detective.

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
..

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,780
Observe, Watson, our nocturnal visitor has been most careless.

00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,620
The marks upon this sill tell me she stood here for some moments before deciding to knock.

00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,960
She homes, you are certain the visitor was a lady?

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,599
..

00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:40,280
Indisputably. The narrow breadth of the heel, the slight inward turn,

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,079
and the impression of a high in step, feminine traits. Watson!

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,119
..

00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,780
Moreover, the sole bears traces of a rare soil, laterite, rich with iron and red clay,

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,299
found only in certain valleys of the Amazon basin.

00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:03,949
You astonish me, Holmes. Are you implying that a woman from South America visited Baker Street in the dead of night?

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:08,560
Indeed. And she left in haste, dropping this token of her errand.

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,949
Hmm. A ring. Hmm.

00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:15,840
A remarkable one. Note the carving upon its surface.

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,939
A serpent entwined around a tree, its eyes two small emeralds.

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,060
The craftsmanship suggests Amazonian origin

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,459
Likely a relic of an indigenous tribe

00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,270
See this faint inscription upon the inner band?

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,219
The letters sing Latin

00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,280
Vincorum codis

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Bond of the heart

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,129
What could such words mean?

00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:43,359
Perhaps, Watson, a matter of passion and peril

00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,980
In my experience, such tokens seldom travel alone

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,579
They carry secrets heavier than gold

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,649
But if she left it unintentionally, she must return for it.

00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,199
Exactly. And when she does, we shall be ready to receive her.

00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:58,959
But...

00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,960
..

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,620
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,639
...

00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:09,030
Pray, madam. Enter. You are expected.

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,099
Mr. Holmes, I have come to seek your aid.

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,620
.....

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,159
It concerns my father's disappearance in the forests of the Amazon

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,250
and this ring which was sent to me with no explanation.

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,500
Indeed, the Amazon again, Watson. The plot thickens.

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,209
And thus began one of the strangest cases that ever engaged Holmes' extraordinary powers,

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,530
the affair, Hour of the Amazon Ring.

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,909
By the time the afternoon lamps flicker alive in Baker Street,

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,750
the fog had thickened into a yellowish haze that wrapped the city in uneasy silence.

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,379
Holmes, after an hour's intense reading of the lady's letter,

00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,120
had declared that the matter required immediate inquiry at a certain riverside warehouse.

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,569
Watson, bring your revolver.

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,899
The situation promises complication,

00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:02,879
and I should not wish to meet danger unprepared.

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,159
...

00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,349
Holmes, you speak as though Peril already walks beside us.

00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,080
When a mystery begins with soil from the Amazon,

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,980
on and an anonymous letter written in half-burned park. I never exclude danger, my dear fellow.

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:29,659
Come, our cab awaits. Miss de Alvarado, your letter spoke of your father's expedition to

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:38,580
the Rio Negro. He disappeared three years ago, did he not? Yes, Mr. Holmes. He led a small team

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,460
seeking ancient ruins along the upper Amazon.

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,480
.......

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,329
Only fragments of his notes return to London,

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,360
this ring among them delivered by an unknown sailor

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,769
who vanished the next day.

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,889
The handwriting differs from your father's.

00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,120
Yet the ink see here, Watson,

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,560
contains particles of red laterite,

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
identical to those on the ring.

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,360
Whoever wrote this must have handled that same soil.

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,569
But how could Amazon soil appear upon paper in London?

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:19,590
Ha ha, my dear Watson, that is precisely the question we are about to answer.

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:28,550
There exists, along the Thames, a warehouse belonging to a trading company once engaged in South American ventures.

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,139
Mr. Alvarado's letter bears their watermark.

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,139
We shall see what remains within.

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,219
..

00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:39,300
This place looks abandoned, Holmes, yet the lock appears new.

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,539
..

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,000
New locks upon old doors are always worth one's curiosity.

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,520
.....

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,810
Observe the footprints, what's unfresh and layered with the same reddish dust we found this morning.

00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,839
Then someone has been here recently.

00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:05,740
Precisely. And this soil note, its moist texture was not carried by mere accident.

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,039
..

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,240
It has been recently unbacked, suggesting a shipment from abroad. We must find the manifest.

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,599
..

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:22,560
Here we are. Shipment from Manaus, dated two weeks ago. Destination, London docks,

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
consignee unknown.

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,280
..

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
But what is this?

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,300
..

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,620
Property of E.

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,259
..

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,370
D. Alvarado.

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,750
Miss, your father's name.

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,310
Good heavens, Holmes.

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,439
If a father's name is still used in trade,

00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,740
someone must be posing as him, or worse.

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,389
Indeed, Watson.

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,279
We face an imposter,

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,220
one who traffics in relics

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,410
that should have remained buried.

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,459
We shall confront this phantom

00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,330
at the docks before dawn.

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,449
And thus began the second act of our strange pursuit,

00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,069
the trail of red soil leading us from the quay,

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,230
key of Baker Street,

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,379
to the misty heart of London's river trade.

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,800
Tabwees ratted to a halt

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,840
before the labyrinth of London's docks.

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,860
A heavy fog drifted from the river,

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
swallowing every sound and shape

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,620
until even the lamplight appeared

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,899
as blurred halos in the murk.

00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,139
Holmes descended first,

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,899
his lean figure half lost

00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,819
against the spectrum masts and cranes

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,250
that loomed like gallows in the mist.

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,019
Observe, Watson, these tracks upon the planks.

00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,459
Two men passed here within the hour, burdened by weight.

00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,409
The soil residue is again that same crimson dust.

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,289
The same dust? Beyond question.

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,980
Then the imposter used these docks to land his cargo from the Amazon.

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,129
Exactly, my dear fellow.

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:48,399
And these crates, note their stenciling, manas, export, company.

00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,860
company. The link to Brazil is complete. Then these shipments were addressed to her

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,340
father's name. But what purpose could compel someone to masquerade as Professor de Aguardo?

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:06,699
The answer, Watson, lies likely in those smaller chests near the gangway. Their locks are sealed

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:15,839
with fresh wax. An artless precaution against thrying eyes just gains eyes. Aha! See here

00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,269
Here specimens of red clay packed with primitive ornaments.

00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:25,720
Our adversary smuggles relics, Watson, contraband torn from Amazonian graves.

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,139
..

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,350
Good heavens, Holmes, the theft of sacred artefacts!

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,580
This explains the ring.

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,950
It must have been part of such a collection.

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:41,220
Then my father's name has been used to desecrate the very land he sought to preserve.

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:48,129
Oh, mister! Holmes, how shall I bear such shame?

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:54,699
Courage, madam. Truth absorbs all honest hearts. The guilty will soon reveal themselves.

00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,600
The...

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,110
Someone approaches there, along the starboard gangway.

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,740
Remain quiet. Let the phantom declare itself.

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,959
There, by the lantern, a figure moving.

00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,040
moving.

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,800
..

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,519
Stand where you are.

00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,250
You are known to us.

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,449
You are too late, Mr. Holmes.

00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,740
The river carries secrets no man may recover.

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,120
The parcel gone into the Thames.

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,050
Yet not all is lost, Watson.

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,920
Observe.

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
..

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,289
The man dropped this in his haste.

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:32,480
A clasp of South American design, englazed with the same serpent emblem as upon the ring.

00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,660
The chain of evidence tightens, my dear Watson.

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:45,730
And so beneath this ghostly fog, we gained our first tangible link to the man who dared to traffic in the mysteries of the Amazon.

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:53,069
Watson, it is now evident that these two pieces, the ring and the clasp, are inseparable.

00:08:53,069 --> 00:09:01,899
Their connection is symbolic and functional, a guide left by those who held knowledge of the Amazon's hidden relics.

00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,919
Then the serpent motif is more than ornamentation. It is a signpost left by your father, Miss

00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,600
the Alvarado.

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,700
..

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,399
Precisely, Watson. Note how the twin emeralds align with openings in the clasp. Together

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,069
they form a secret lock known only to the rightful heir. This is no ordinary ornament.

00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:30,480
It conceals knowledge. Observe. The clasp clicks into place. Inside lies a hidden compartment.

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
..

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:45,890
Exactly! These instructions were meant for those he trusted. The serpent mark is both warning and guidance. Whoever possesses this key knows the path he charted along the Amazon.

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,740
Then the imposter sought to exploit your father's name for profit and secrecy. The ring and journal are the true keys to his legacy.

00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:00,820
sea. To the docks again, Watson. The serpent mark leads to the imposter's lair. Today the secret

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,329
shall be unveiled. There. Do you see the boat drifting slowly, Watson? Our adversary returns,

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:15,080
unaware that we are watching. Observe his stance, Watson. The serpent mark on his vest gives him

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,120
away. He is our imposter. Open the chest. The ring, the clasp, and the journal belong to

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,279
Miss de Alvarado. Your theft ends now. My father's work saved. Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,980
As the sunlight glinted off the river, I observed Holmes surveying the docks with his usual

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,340
intensity, noting every shadow, every glint of metal. The imposter subdued. Yet the weight of

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,650
of the Amazon's mysteries seem to linger upon us still,

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,299
like the mist that clung stubbornly to the water.

00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,639
Notice, Watson, that even in triumph,

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,869
a detective must observe.

00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:54,629
The river reveals nothing yet.

00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,820
Everything.

00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,480
The slightest disturbance is a clue

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,559
to intentions unseen.

00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,240
...

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,600
Holmes, now that the imposter is exposed,

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,849
can we truly rest,

00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,639
knowing these artifacts were touched by human greed?

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:27,600
..................

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,480
And so, beneath the tear-mourning sky, the Amazon ring's secret returned to its rightful

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,100
keeper, an imposter unmasked, and Holmes once more reminded me that deduction, patience,

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,329
and observation triumph over deception.

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:41,649
Come, Watson.

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:43,860
The docks have yielded their secret,

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,410
yet the adventure is not concluded.

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,759
We must return

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,629
and analyze these artifacts in detail.

00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,460
Knowledge alone can safeguard them

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,039
against future theft.

00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,960
..

00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,139
Chanteed, Holmes, why what?

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,659
Ching Ma, each case confirms your maxim.

00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:02,639
Observation reveals

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,529
what the eye alone cannot discern.

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,980
And now the serpent mark

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,860
has led us to victory,

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,420
though I suspect its lessons are far from finished.

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,220
The serpent mark revealed the path.

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,779
Watson!

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,840
..

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,029
Knowledge, patience and deduction have preserved the Amazon's secret.

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:26,039
Let us now return and ensure the artifacts and their story remain safe.

00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,769
And so as the cab rolled away from the docks, I felt a mixture of relief and awe.

00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,539
Hones had once more deciphered the threads of human deceit,

00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,990
Revealing not only the imposter but the wisdom hidden in a serpent's secret mark,

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,289
Ford, I've wondered what further adventures lay in the shadow of this victory.

00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,799
The cab guided us through London streets.

00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,190
Yet a sense of anticipation clung like fog.

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,240
Holmes dripped the ring and journal tightly,

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,100
as though they alone could unlock the final puzzle.

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,460
Watson, the imposter is nearby.

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,829
Our next step is his hideout.

00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,480
The serpent mark will guide us.

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,890
The alley seems deserted, Holmes.

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,759
Yet I sense he watches us from shadow.

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,080
You, you have no right to interfere.

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,179
..

00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,069
Open your hands.

00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:11,559
The chest, the ring, the journal, all belong to Miss Del Verado.

00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,940
.....

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,620
Now, Watson, we recover all stolen artifacts.

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,889
The Amazon Green's secret must return.

00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,379
Elementary, Watson.

00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,639
Deduction revealed the thief and the treasure.

00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,820
Each piece now tells its rightful story.

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,720
story. The Amazon ring is safe, the imposter neutralized and Miss de Alvarado's inheritance

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:47,059
preserved. Elementary, Watson. Observation and patience preserve knowledge. Justice is served

00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:54,100
and the legacy remains. And so, with the imposter unmasked, the Amazon ring secured and the journal

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,440
returned, a chapter of adventure and human folly closed, leaving us prepared for the next case.

00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,820
.
