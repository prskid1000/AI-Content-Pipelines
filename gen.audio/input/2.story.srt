00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,219
It was a warm afternoon in Baker Street and the hum of wheels upon the Marylebone Road

00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,390
came through our open window like a constant.

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,859
Vention drummer marking time for London's immeasurable heart.

00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,219
Owens lay at length upon the sofa, his keen eyes half-lidded.

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,300
The violin at his side, as though it were a sword, sheathed after some brisk engagement

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,980
while I, ever the pupil, poured over a botany monograph he had placed in my hands

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,820
to demonstrate how ash upon a man's cuff could betray not only his trade

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,539
but his parish and his habits of weathering and exercise he insisted was excellent for the muscles

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:38,640
of attention my dear watson if the monograph bores you close it with a clear conscience

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,740
a muscle overstrained is as unfit for service as one untrained and i would rather you kept your

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,679
powers supple for something more diverting that is presently ascending our stare i started at that

00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,560
for I had heard no bell and seen no shadow, and I ventured to ask him how he came by his certainty

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,239
that a visitor was upon us, and what manner of visitor it might be to draw his interest

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,219
from the idle doper which sometimes claimed him between cases. The aroma of Otto, of violet

00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:17,120
mingled with a faint whiff of coal gas from a private carriage lamp, the delicate scrib

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:27,659
clib of a narrow heel that has recently had its lift renewed, and a flutter of kid glove against

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,359
gourd-cloth, the housemaid's breath caught twice at the landing, which she does only when a

00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:42,299
personage of consequence appears in some is a lady of rank coming in haste with a matter she

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,079
she thinks romantic, but which the law would call practical, and I, for one, am grateful to romance

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:57,159
for the practice it affords. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Dr. being Comet, Watson, forgive this intrusion

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,040
at such an hour, yet the hour presses me more rudely than my conscience. I am Violet, Duchess

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,060
of Ravenscar, and I am sorely plagued by a masquerade that has leapt the footlights to tread

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,740
at the boards of life, a masquerade that calls itself Prince Charming.

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:38,060
...........................

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,000
can afford to droot how this courtly prince has come to offend your house it began sir with letters

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,340
that promised deliverance from dullness and a rain of happiness that seemed penned by a playwright

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,840
they were addressed not to me but to my niece lady beatrice waven scar who is of an age to dream

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,280
and i fear to pay for dreaming a masked figure calling himself prince charming contrived to

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,840
meet her on the terrace of my London house after a charity ball and pressed upon her

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,879
a crystal slipper pendant set with small diamonds. Last evening the pendant vanished. A second

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,120
note arrived, you Anna? And this time there wasn't it a threat that if she did not meet

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:30,539
him as commanded at midnight by the Cleopatra's needle, he would reveal matters that would

00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,219
would destroy her reputation.

00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,560
..

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,020
Holmes turned the pasteboard under his long fingers

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,810
and the thin lips compressed lightly,

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,360
like a violinist hearing a false note slip

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,800
within a difficult phrase.

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,969
And in that instant,

00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,719
I realized that what had stirred him

00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,699
was not a question of petty romance,

00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,620
but a scent of organized villainy

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,879
dressed out in theatrical tinsels.

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,490
Your Grace,

00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,629
this silver dust upon the edge is not silver,

00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:58,759
but powdered tin from a cheap theatrical milliner.

00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,050
The glue is of a common French.

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,230
Make rarely sold in London except to costumiers.

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,769
There is, hmm, moreover, hmm,

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,780
a faint granularity that tells of flower-stage confetti

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,870
that has been trampled and swept.

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,439
I venture we have to do with a person who passes with ease

00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,950
between the green room and the drawing-room trower.

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,199
And who knows that London ladies are most credulous

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,220
when the footlights of imagination are upon them.

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,759
We had the misfortune to attend a pantomime at the Savoy last week

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,420
where a certain actor, adored by the town,

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,129
played a prince with a slipper that set the audience laughing and sighing.

00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,240
My niece has a taste for that sort of nonsense.

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,300
..

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,699
Yet I cannot believe the player himself would sink to extortion

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,110
and still my house is haunted by this foolish symbol.

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,259
I asked, perhaps with less tact than the situation warranted,

00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,180
whether Lady Beatrice had ever given cause for scandal

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,879
and the Duchess answered with the cold dignity of her class

00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,810
that the child's only scandal was innocence carried to the verge of imprudence,

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,980
quality which, as a medical man, I have seen draw more trouble than malice ever could.

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,779
You have the second letter, your grace.

00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:22,639
Let us hear its voice, for paper is a superb confessional,

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,319
when the writer is vain and the ink has not fully dried on his conceit.

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,359
...

00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:36,039
Sir, you will observe it is scented, and that certain words are underlined with a playful hand,

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,680
it commands Beatrice to come alone, to wear white,

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,420
and to carry with her a small gasket of heirloom jewels as pledge

00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,769
and it assures her that all will be merry as a Christmas pantomime if she comply.

00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,300
Holmes raised the letter to his nostrils and then to the light

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,680
and at last held it flat while he measured the spacing with the blade of his knife

00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,939
as though it were a yardstick.

00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,889
He tapped the margin twice and then smiled without mirth.

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:08,360
Observe, Watson, the faint transliteration where another sheet has pressed upon it.

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,600
This man keeps a ledger and writes his commands upon a pad

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,420
Tearing off the page and leaving the ghost of his commerce upon the next

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,040
The underlining is not caprice but code for the placement of a rendezvous guard

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,000
These two underlines signal the embankment stair

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,839
And the final flourish denotes the hour as the stroke

00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,939
Not five minutes past or before

00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,240
For such precision betrays a military sense

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,250
mated to a theatrical taste, jela kulda.

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,079
A union not uncommon in certain bankrupt officers

00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,220
out of India who have learned to drill illusions

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,300
as once they drilled men.

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,620
..

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,660
Mr. Herm, Holmes, can you protect my niece

00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,009
without parading her name before the newspapers?

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,240
For I would sooner risk my fortune than her good repute

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,079
and I know not where to turn but to your singular methods

00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,839
which all London praises and half believes.

00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,900
..

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,120
You did perfectly to come.

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,529
We shall not consult the newspapers,

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,100
but we may consult the Savoy and the Needle

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,159
and one or two alleyways that run between.

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,800
And if we meet our prince, we shall bow low and, I trust,

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,310
pick his pocket of every pretense he carries.

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,560
The Duchess drew forth another object,

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,839
Then, a slipper charm of crystal cleverly cut to catch the light, and on its toe, a

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,959
nick so minute that I would not have noticed it had it not been set at the very point like

00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,409
a dimple.

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:44,550
She said it was the token first given, and that Beatrice had kept it like a schoolgirl.

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:51,319
This nick is not a flaw, but a maker's sign, scratched with a needle by one who believes

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,210
in private.

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,709
Ha!

00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:52,920
Ha!

00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:03,920
ill marks we shall look for its twin and finding it shall find the hand that held the needle watson your hat your grace

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:16,660
send lady beatrice to her aunt's house in bayswater for the evening and trust us to keep the midnight appointment you fear so we shall not keep it exactly in the manner commanded

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,610
I am in your debt, gentlemen. I shall remove Beatrice at once and hold myself ready to receive you.

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:32,650
And I shall pray with all the fervour that society permits that your science of deduction is as gentle with her heart as it is stern with her adversaries.

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:39,779
The Duchess withdrew with a sweep of violet zinc and a perfume that lingered like a cord struck and still vibrating,

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,100
celebrating, Contelling, Morte and Beganingses, you nutting

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,750
veer!

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,500
Hm! and Holmes, with that sudden accession of energy, which I had come to associate with

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,899
the scent of the chase, sprang up, took down his inverness, and thrust into his pocket

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,519
a small lens, a lent of strong black cord, and a packet of those curious handcuffs of

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,019
his own design, which had before now shut upon wrists that thought themselves as nimble

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:03,500
as eels.

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,899
The Savoy, Watson, if our Prince has learned his manners upon the stage,

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,379
the stage will betray him with a frankness the drawing-room never would.

00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,759
Then our tour of the green-room will still teach us

00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,100
what flower clings to a cheap crown and what paste to a counterfeit heart.

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
..

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,370
London that afternoon wore its familiar mask of indifference.

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,339
The cabman slouch, the newsboys cry.

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,899
The rivers drowned patience, and yet to me it seemed as if every cornice were an eyebrow

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,169
and every lamp a lid lowered over a conspirator's wink.

00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,639
For I knew that in the metropolis the romance of the theatre

00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,629
and the precision of crime have often taken the same handsome to their rendezvous.

00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:54,279
You observe, Watson, here, how the ash of this driver's cigar

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,609
flicks into wedgelets rather than moat.

00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,279
He smokes a cheap.

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,720
...

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,639
If he were to turn his head, we should see a burn on his right labelle, where he knocks

00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,779
away the ash with his forefinger, which, I might add, he would not do if he were left-handed.

00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:20,129
The city is an alphabet, and we advance only as we consent to learn our letters.

00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:24,740
We alighted at the Savoy and were admitted backstage by an old watchman who recognized

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,480
in homes the authority of one who is never refused twice. Within, the word altered, for here were the

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,659
raw and intimate limbs of illusion ropes, flats, plaster crowns, and that compound odor of grease

00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:41,159
paint, damp canvas, and stale bouquets that speaks of triumph and disappointment sleeping in the same

00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:49,320
trunk. Good evening. We seek Mr. Lionel Vale of the company, the gentleman whose prince charming

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,909
has lately fluttered a number of foolish hearts in higher boxes than you are accustomed to admire from the pit.

00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:01,569
Sir, I am he, though I blush to own that my flutterings are but the joint endeavour of author,

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:07,819
Taylor, and limelight, to what happy mischance do I owe a visit from Mr. Fom, Mr. Fom, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:10,840
whose praises are sung even in our paint-stained realm.

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,539
Hmm, Mr. Well, it is not your art, I question, but a parody of it.

00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:32,460
someone has taken your princely wares to market in the open streets has any stranger asked to purchase one of your glass slippers not in the lobby shop but out of hours and in such a manner as would tickle a conscience even less fastidious than your own

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,220
By your leave, sir.

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,240
Some fortnight-pastor fellow with a cavalry moustache and a gait like a drill sergeant

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,900
came to my dressing room with a notion to buy an old prop slipper.

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,710
Saying he craved it as a keepsake for a lady who dreamed of the stage,

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,019
I thought him an honest, if theatrical, admirer.

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,360
But our property master denied him, for the slippers belonged to the house.

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,529
Hones's eyes brightened at that description.

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,250
Aye!

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,650
And he fingered the Christou charm in his pocket,

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,039
as if measuring it against an unseen pattern.

00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,039
Then he asked if there had been any thefts among the properties,

00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,799
or a surplus of confetti, unlike the house's own.

00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,039
Archie, it was a sack of confetti gone astray three nights ago,

00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,620
and a dresser dismissed for pilfering flour for some prank.

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,740
Also, there came to us a lady journalist

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,089
seeking notes for a column on the morals of the theatre,

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,460
though she had more of the student than the scold about her,

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,960
and she asked very particular questions

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,100
about how one gains entry to a grand house under a mask.

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,549
Her name, if you please,

00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:26,009
and whether she wore upon her wrist a narrow black ribbon,

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:28,399
such as certain ladies of the pen,

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,000
then affect because it holds a pencil nimbly when the hands are otherwise engaged

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,019
......

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,059
miss sybil hart sir and she had indeed a black ribbon and a pair of eyes that would have made

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,899
a moralist forgive the theater and the theater forgive the moralist in a single look but she

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:53,360
was harmless as a sparrow i'd take my oath upon it we thanked the player and turned to go and as

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,200
we passed the property room but your home's net without ceremony upon the scuff boards and with

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,059
With his lens examined a line of tiny scratches that the most domestic groom would never trouble to observe,

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,470
he plucked from a crack a glane of something that glinted dully.

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:14,019
A shard from a cheap crystal mould and a powdering of tin, our prince has shod himself here, now.

00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,299
..

00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:22,220
Watson, to the embankment before the lamps are lit, for a staircase keeps better counsel by daylight

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,600
and the river speaks more plainly in the afternoon than at midnight.

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,090
night. When rogues suppose it asleep, thus began, under that deceptive warm afternoon,

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,210
the adventure of the prince charming, and I confess that I felt in my very pulse,

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,019
the strange mingling of innocence and calculation that runs through all such days,

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,960
for what is a fairy story, but a criminal enterprise with better costumes, and what

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,980
is a criminal enterprise, but a fairy story, that has mislaid its conscience,

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,039
and barely remember its moral.

00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,639
The Thames lounged beneath the embankment

00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,799
like a sated python,

00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,899
its coils catching pewter gleams

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,799
where a pallid sun worried the surface.

00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,539
We descended the stone stairs by Keopatra's needle

00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,299
and Holmes went on before me

00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,539
with the remorseless patience

00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,650
of a pointer taking scent after a rain,

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,279
the wind bore upward the odor of tar,

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,179
stale dread from a hawker's guard

00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,820
and the indefinable sourness of damstone

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,610
where many feet have hesitated.

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,820
Note, Watson,

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:42,180
The chalk marks upon the third riser from the water, not the idle doodles of a child, but a system, triangles, bared, tip to tip, and, here, a circlet intersected by a dash, thieves' cant, imported from the continent, recently naturalized among certain London cracksmen who fancy themselves men of letters.

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:59,620
I peered, and though the scrawls seemed innocent as a schoolroom slate left unattended, the arrangement, two triangles pointing east and west, the circlet, like a stubborn son held on a leash, cast a discomfort upon me as though I had deciphered a whisper not meant for my ear and found there my own name.

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:07,120
East-West denotes the play of watchers in pairs. Sure, while the circlet with a bar declares a

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:16,139
deposit, our Prince commands not only the lady, but her casket. This stare, then, is both rendezvous

00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:22,379
and purse. A careless convenience that will serve until the police grow interested, I think we shall

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,360
rob him of the experiment tonight and provide him a debut he did not rehearse. Holmes knelt,

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,159
and from the thin gap between the second and third stones

00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,129
drew a slender ribbon of black, kateyoth, that clung oddly.

00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:38,769
Having caught on a snag, at one end was affixed a small clasp,

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,879
bright with recent purchase, and within the clasp a hard crumb of soap.

00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:49,269
The ribbon of our lady journalist, or her cousin, the soap is a better witness.

00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:56,360
It holds in its heart the faintest print of a cipher traced by a damp finger and left to dry.

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,659
eye. Observe how the tiny planes pale differently where pressure lay. The message would have been

00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:08,440
mirrored to the glass to be read by the intended eye. We must reconstruct the phrase, which,

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,700
with your indulgence, I will do now upon my cuff. With a pencil, he made a set of small marks,

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,539
and then a series of lines joining them like stars mapped into a constellation. In no great

00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:25,179
time he had a sentence that, even to my unschooled gaze, possessed a certain sly elegance,

00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,360
befitting a theatrically minded villain.

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:55,179
............................

00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:00,359
He stood and looked upon the river and the great obelisk, as if consulting antiquity for advice on more.

00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:05,809
Turned scoundrels, then he touched my sleeve and drew me toward a bench where a man of compact figure,

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:10,759
with an impeded moustache, sat polishing a walking stick whose silver fox's head gleamed like a grin.

00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,380
..

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,030
Good afternoon, Colonel.

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:19,640
Let us say Colonel, for the gate informs me more accurately than the stick

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,380
and allow me to recommend that a man who conducts business upon public steps

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,819
should at least polish his stick where it cannot be recognized by a watchman

00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,490
who reads the illustrated weeklies.

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,849
I do not know you and do not thank you.

00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,750
The river is common property and my stick is my own affair.

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,140
If you have business, bring it to me through my solicitor as honest men do.

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,480
My business is generally brought to me by rogues who cannot afford solicitors.

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,039
Your boots, with their square toes and the longer wear upon the outer heel,

00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,539
declare a military drill upon hard parade grounds.

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,779
Your Styx fox was engraved in Bombay.

00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,340
The scar on your knuckle is of a sabre's kiss,

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,940
and your eye has that restless stageward glance of a man who watches exits and entrances.

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,059
In short, away, away!

00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,889
Away, Colonel Mordaunt, late of the 17th.

00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:20,680
Now at the green room and the gambling room, the cards are upon the table.

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,700
..

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,500
You will find, sir, that my cards are clean, as for my past.

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,470
I display it freely because it is honourable.

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,590
And if I like to see a play of an evening, I do so as a patron and not as a player.

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,050
Now, if you will excuse me, I must attend to dinner.

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,949
He rose with a stiffness that betrayed a recent strain of the knee and walked off with more dignity.

00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,660
then I would have credited to a man thus accosted.

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,220
Yet I saw that his hand tightened on the fox's head

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,269
until the silver whitened under pressure,

00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,740
a sign of anger that does not end at dinner.

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,840
The colonel will figure again.

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,759
A man does not carry Bombay in his pocket and the theatre in his eye.

00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,929
Without intending to spend both upon some operation,

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:04,230
we must discover his company.

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,720
Poor princes generally travel with a colonel to carry their baggage.

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,900
From the stair we went to Bayswater,

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Where the Duchess had lodged her niece with a common practicality that sits well upon uncommon rank,

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,949
Lady Beatrice received us with that mixture of embarrassment and relief which speaks of an indiscretion unconsummated.

00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:26,799
And at once she began to protest her innocence, until home stayed her with a courtesy so grave

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,860
that it made her childish protestation seem superfluous.

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,339
Lady Beatrice, your reputation is not on trial here. Facts are.

00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:40,460
and facts will do you the charity of keeping your name out of the mouths of those persons

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:47,599
who nourish themselves on scandal tell me please how the first meeting came about

00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:55,119
and why you consented to listen again when you had suspected harm sir at the charity ball the

00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,160
music was so bright and the air so full of laughing that when a gentleman in a silver mask

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:12,880
bowed and recited a line from the very play we had applauded i thought it a jest sanctioned by the company he spoke of rescuing me from dullness and said that london was a pumpkin that only the bold could roll into a carriage i laughed

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:26,519
sir as stupid girls do and later in the garden he placed the little snipper in my hand and whispered that a prince must have a pledge if he is to claim a dance for life she said this with so touching an ingenuousness that i trembled at the thought of what wolves there

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,849
are in the polite woods of our capital, and I could not but think of the many little tokens,

00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:35,640
charms, flowers, pins that pass between the sexes as though they were nothing more than

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,180
sparks shaken from a heart when in truth they may set houses ablaze.

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,819
And when the second letter came, you did not intend to obey it,

00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:48,599
yet you feared what it threatened, and so you hesitated.

00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,220
Which is precisely the interval upon which blackmail fattens.

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,980
May I examine your jewel casket and the place where you kept the slipper?

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,259
...

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,820
Hmm, certainly, mister. Hmm.

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,720
Holmes, the slipper lay upon my dressing table by the looking glass.

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,579
The casket is here, and you will see that the lining bears a little scratch where the charm used to rest.

00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:18,619
Holmes bent over the glass as though it were a lake from which any number of drowned truths might be.

00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:24,619
He fished, he breathed upon it, and, with the sleeve of his coat, conjured up faint smears that, to my surprise,

00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:30,210
whose resolved into letters not unlike those I had seen upon the soap-crumb at the embankment.

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:38,190
The same cipher traced with a damp finger, and wiped in haste, and here, upon the casket's velvet,

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,630
a thread from a cuff of cheap lace, your maid, Lady Beatrice.

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,559
Is she a reader of penny romances, and fond of the theatre?

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,160
her? Alice is a good girl, sir, though she loves the gallery, and will sometimes quote lines as

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,099
she braids my hair. She has never done me harm that I know. We shall make no enemies where

00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:05,839
servants are concerned, unless they make us. Still, I must see Alice, to ask her whether she

00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:13,200
has lately acquired a ribbon for her wrist, with a clasp of the sort your humble mirror has described.

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,279
..

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,090
Alice is below, sir. You may command her attendance and, if she is foolish, you will find her quickly out.

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,530
But I beg you not to frighten her more than is needed.

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,710
Alice, a slim, pretty creature with anxious eyes, entered at a curtsy.

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:34,759
And Holmes addressed her with that austere kindness which makes the simple tell the truth as if they had always meant to do so and had only been waiting for permission.

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,839
..

00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,400
Alice, the truth is the cheapest ribbon you can buy and the strongest, did you, in the last week?

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,920
....

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,140
Lend your wrist ribbon to a lady who writes for a newspaper

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,759
and who has a curiosity about noble houses that exceeds the price of her column.

00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,190
Oh, sir, I did lend it,

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,400
but only because she said a lady can remember more with a pencil at her hand

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,059
than with a poem in her head.

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,900
She was kind to me and spoke as though she were my sister.

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,579
Mr. Huh!

00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,940
...

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,440
Yay!

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,900
..

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,039
And she asked me how one might get a footman

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,839
to look the other way at a ball

00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,679
if the footman were honest but human.

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,929
And did she tell you her name?

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,420
And did she give you anything in return

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,940
besides the pleasure of friendly talk?

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,059
Miss Sybil Hart, sir,

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,180
as she gave me a little book of verses

00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,759
and a ticket for the Savoy Gallery,

00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,250
I meant no harm.

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,700
Oh, I never do.

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,269
I never do.

00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:42,460
Holmes inclined his head, satisfied, satisfied.

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,140
And when the girl had withdrawn, he turned to us with that peculiar brightness in his gaze

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,210
which signals the construction of a plan.

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,279
As if the mind had just hung a new chandelier and was testing the switches with a finger of light.

00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,440
..

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,530
The plot thickens with Flower and Lise Watson.

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,160
We have a colonel with a fox's head cane.

00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,059
a journalist with a black ribbon, a stage prince with admirers and missing confetti,

00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,509
and a cipher that goes from river stair to looking glass.

00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:17,230
Tonight, at midnight, we shall keep the appointment, though not as commanded,

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,500
and we shall see whether the slipper breaks or the spell does.

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,789
It was agreed that I should act as decoy, for I bore no resemblance to a lady in white,

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,880
and it is exactly in that absence that a trap can be baited,

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,440
if a man be cautious and a friend be near with a cord and a pair of cuffs,

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,099
we return to Baker Street to prepare.

00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,319
And there I watched Holmes arrange our little stage

00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,430
with the cool zest of a manager mounting a new piece.

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,500
You shall stand upon the stair where the triangles meet,

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,069
Watson, with the casket empty,

00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,909
but so ballasted as to persuade,

00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,920
I shall keep the shadow to your north,

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,619
and we shall allow the watcher to reveal himself

00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:02,839
yourself by the angle of his impatience. Do not be heroic, be punctual.

00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,099
..

00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:09,059
Poor Admidnight found us in position. The river lapped and the stone breathed its damp for long

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:14,099
minutes. No, thing occurred, but the swell of the tide and the far-off walls of some late house

00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:19,980
where the party ha, dee, long outstayed propriety. Then there came a rustle as of silk, denied a

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,660
stage, and a figure in a pale cloak, slim and must, stood at the top of the stair like a thought that

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,720
that has come too soon.

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,930
Gentlemen, you are not a lady,

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,059
and you are not alone.

00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,299
And yet you have brought the casket

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,589
like obedient boys playing rogues.

00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:36,869
I advise you to dismiss the shadow,

00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,420
Mr. Holmes, or else to employ me,

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,809
for I am not the enemy you think.

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,700
Miss Sybil Hart,

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,740
you could not hold your tongue

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,829
even if the plot depended upon it.

00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,160
Tell us quickly how you come to Bali

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,079
on the wrong side of the proscenium,

00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,359
and why I should not summon Lestrade

00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,329
to grant your column a freshness it seldom enjoys.

00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,980
Hmm, because, sir, hmm,

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,240
the prince you hunt threatens ladies

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,949
who will never forgive the police,

00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,389
but might forgive a pen.

00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:09,359
And because I have traced him to a ring of gentlemen

00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,920
who gamble away fortunes they do not own

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,429
and recover them by charming pledges out of innocence,

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:17,769
let me help you, and I will earn, for once,

00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:19,529
a headline that is honest.

00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:22,819
Her voice carried an edge of fearless mockery

00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:26,619
and yet a gravity that made mockery seem a form of coup.

00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,720
Oh!

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,110
Rage, Holmes.

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,559
Coup prizes evidence but also admires style

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,159
where it supports truth.

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,200
Lowered the hand that had gripped the cord

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,759
and inclined his head a fraction.

00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,160
..

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,180
Speak.

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,680
Then, and be advised

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,740
that the river is stingy with second chances.

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,529
Name your prince and his throne.

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:52,299
His nom de bal is Prince Charming, his true name.

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:55,860
so far as any man with three club memberships has.

00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,539
A true name is Sir Alistair Mordaunt.

00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,159
His quartermaster is a soldier who left his honour in Bombay.

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,160
His theatre is the Savoy when the lights are up

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,990
and Holland House when they are down tomorrow night.

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,480
There is a masked charity fete

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,279
where he intends to collect three pledges in a single minuet.

00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,099
And if you are not there,

00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:20,480
the season will wake to scandal harsh enough to make ballad sheets fat.

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,509
A shadow moved at the waterline, a second watcher, and before I could call out,

00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:29,159
Holmes's whistle split the gloom and a shape leapt from a skiff.

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,230
Then another, there was a brief scuffle of feet and oats like broken glass,

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,230
and our unseen listeners fled along the bank with the cat-like stride of men trained to vanish.

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,039
They are cautious enough to keep their names for the program tomorrow.

00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,010
Very well, Miss Hart.

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,530
You have bought yourself a seat in the orchestra, Watson.

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,460
Polish your boots and your eyes.

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:57,599
We, too, shall go to the ball, and I think our Prince will find his slip a pinches when

00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,039
worn upon a foot that does not fit."

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,440
Holland House, on the appointed evening, glowed like a conjured palace, and its gardens held

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,670
those whispering lamps which make sin and charity indistinguishable at a distance.

00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,119
Holmes, who affected a plain footman's livery with such exactitude that I caught myself

00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,180
myself twice about to hand him my gloves, had arranged the passes for our entrance by

00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,880
means known only to himself and perhaps to one flustered clerk whom he had hypnotized

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,300
with logic and tipped with half a sovereign.

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,059
Remember Watson, that a mask is a confession printed upon satin.

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:38,579
The honest man wears his own face uneasily, and the scoundrel wears a false one, as if

00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:40,170
it had grown upon him.

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,099
Keep to the edges!

00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,680
Observe the hands.

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:50,140
hands, always the hands, and when the couplet is recited about pumpkins turning to coaches,

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,639
note who glances toward the terrace, for he is rehearsing the exit.

00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:59,480
I shall take the gallery reserved for the press and ladies of uncertain profession.

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,390
Do not scowl.

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,099
Hmm, doctor, hmm.

00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:07,150
It is a life's work to inhabit uncertainty with a straight back.

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,759
Signal me by the handkerchief.

00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,860
If your prince appears, I have notebooks within my bodice and daring where other women carry smelling salts.

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:22,190
The band struck up, and the great room turned like a slow, complicated machine wound by women's shoulders and men's ambitions.

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,250
I felt acutely my plainness and was grateful for it, for it allowed me to watch without being watched.

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,799
Then I saw him, a gentleman in a silver mask, princely by posture rather than garment,

00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:40,840
Who moved through the throng with the measured self-possession of one who has learned in some harder Academy to command hunger and fatigue?

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:47,500
Sir Alistair more doubt beneath a whimsy of tinfoil the jaw declares him though the mask would deny I

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:55,440
Dee mart the Colonel do paces in a rear his fox's head peeking from the cane like a confidant at confession

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,900
They will separate near the con

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:05,929
on. Servitory! The casket transfer will be under the cover of a coat, no doubt worn threadbare,

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:13,019
from thee. Savoy to positions, my dear fellow, and take care not to admire the roses,

00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:18,840
for their thorns are deputised to-night. From where I stood I saw Lady Beatrice.

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,230
By dress of the Duchess's reconsidered mood, admitted discreetly in my company,

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,880
I am kept near the major only cluster of her scandal-staffs. Yet her eye wandered.

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,509
Hmm, poor child, hmm.

00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,659
With that fatal mixture of curiosity and shame,

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:35,490
which makes Lamb step closer to the wolf to be sure it is a wolf,

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,480
Holmes had arranged that she carry an imitation casket

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,460
while the true heirlooms were under lock

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,380
and that our culprits be allowed to attempt what they had rehearsed

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,980
in order that we might secure not only a single villain but a circle.

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,200
Now there, here the lion whispered,

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,559
to make a pumpkin of the city and a coach of the night,

00:30:53,559 --> 00:31:03,400
and there, the gloved hand lifting as a cue, the colonel slides left, the prince glides right.

00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,590
Miss Hart, prepare your pen, for what follows is a chapter that town will read with its breakfast.

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:17,180
A rose for your pledge, my lady, and a pledge for your rose. Hold the casket so, and think of it

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,880
as a tune you might hum pretty and without consequence,

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,820
even as the air grows crowded.

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,130
Hmm, not so fast.

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,139
Hmm, Colonel, the orchestra's tempo is mine tonight.

00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:36,180
Your fox has run to earth and the hounds are unsportingly close.

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,960
You, sir, again, will you spoil a charity to play constable?

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,819
Or will you be content to drink

00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,150
and let gentlemen amuse themselves as gentlemen do?

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,750
Hones's hand, quick as a stort, had the gasket already. He pressed some hidden latch,

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,039
and out slid not jewels, but a hollow slipper of crystal, cunningly cut to conceal a narrow cavity

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,059
within its heel. Within that, wrapped in waxed paper, lay a slip of foolscap dotted over with

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,480
numbers and names that, even to my untrained intelligence, spell ruin for men accustomed

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:13,160
to silence. A ledger by fairy tale! Sir Alister, you have improved upon Cinderella by fitting the

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,619
a slipper to every foot you chose to threaten. And you have recorded the deaths and indiscretions

00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:25,400
with a bookkeeper's love of the precise. I congratulate you upon your invention and arrest

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,279
you for its inevitable result. Arrest, Mr. Hones, is a word with a vulgar clang. When pronounced

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,859
amid violence, you have a knack for unmasking. But do you not think that the ladies you protect

00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,950
will weep when the newsboys ball their secrets for a penny and a laugh?

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,049
I think, Sir Alistair, that the ladies will sleep after a brief weeping,

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:52,769
and that you, meanwhile, shall discover how iron fits where crystal failed.

00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:57,920
I have sent for Lestrade, who, though he lacks my taste in music,

00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,269
has a baton the law is proud to acknowledge.

00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:05,039
Gentlemen, if you please, anost his to save Mothaf.

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,859
ferv. A word in the ear. Lestrade will be faster if the carriage gauge is kept clear. I have bribed

00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:16,039
the porter with my reputation, which he found surprisingly negotiable, and the police may come

00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,259
in like invited guests if we do not tarry upon the doorstep arguing about the etiquette of arrest.

00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:26,400
You not take my master with a woman's help and a doctor's bag, the fox has more holes than you

00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,099
have. Hmm, we traps, hmm, and we know them in our sleep. The colonel made for the terrace swift,

00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,090
silent and Holmes nodded to me.

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,009
I pursued.

00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:38,279
My old service revolver weighing my pocket

00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,480
not as a promise of violence

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,180
but as a guarantee of steadiness

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,480
for nothing steadies a man

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,549
like knowing no necessity will surprise him.

00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:45,539
In the conservatory,

00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,279
the lantern sent pale islands of light onto the gravel

00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,529
and the colonel turned,

00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,480
cane leveled like a small lance.

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,279
I do not wish to hurt you doctor

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,349
for you have the air of a decent man.

00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,319
Stand aside and let my affair pass by

00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,839
and I will lay my mouth upon silence

00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,460
as upon a Bible.

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,630
You have already kissed away your oath.

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,679
I advise surrender,

00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,720
for the house is surrounded by decency-wearing boots,

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,610
and even the flowers here would testify if called.

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,340
Never argue with a cavalryman

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,029
when he has space to charge.

00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,619
Clip the space, Watson.

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,150
Close, close,

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,199
and turn his lance into a walking stick.

00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,010
I obeyed with a rush.

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,360
Closing the distance,

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,820
the Colonel's cane thrust and blanced from my shoulder.

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,119
I seized it.

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,139
Begleppled.

00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,380
Hmm.

00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,649
And Holmes appeared behind him with the light step of a cat that has learned to tread among glass.

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,980
In an instant, the Colonel's arms were pinned by the black cord from Holmes' pocket.

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,400
His cane burst in two and from the hollow inside fell a coil of fine wire

00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,769
and a tiny bottle of chloroform such as a theatre doctor might carry for fainting ingenues.

00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:55,679
A practical fellow, our Colonel, his honour, like his cane, is hollow

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,000
and hides tools for removing obstacles, Watson.

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Watson secure his wrists Miss Hart Miss Hart do not faint for he has more than enough smelling

00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:13,380
salts for us all and none of it safe I am better at printing crimes than at fainting away from them

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:20,320
I shall go to the gate and bring in your Lestrade like a chorus when the stage needs it do not allow

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,800
Now, Sir Alastair, to improvise, for his ad-libs run to cruelty, eh?

00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,960
..

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,380
Cruelty, madam, is a word ladies use to name justice when it turns and sees them.

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,840
I will answer for nothing. I have not signed.

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,649
And if Mr. Holmes has brought handwriting experts to a ball,

00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:42,440
I shall almost admire him between indictments.

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,750
I have brought something more decisive than experts.

00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,019
Your own vanity. This ledger bears your private.

00:35:50,019 --> 00:36:07,320
marks the same which dented the toe of a gift slipper with a needle so that you might know your handiwork in a crowd your needle speaks across crystal the way a signature does across vellum i fear you have

00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,079
If by fear, ere been too original by half.

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:30,380
...................

00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,219
Evening, Mister.

00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:32,320
..

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,519
Holmes, I see your theatre has found its villain with admirable punctuality.

00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:40,769
Sir Alastair Mordaunt, you would be so good as to accompany me quietly, Colonel.

00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,900
I am sorry to find you a prop in this show.

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,220
London will hiss where it once applauded.

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,260
Spare your sermon for a cheaper gallery.

00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,940
We shall see if your handcuffs fit better than your morolet.

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,860
Peace.

00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,500
...

00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,569
They generally do, Colonel.

00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:58,840
Your fox may run no more.

00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,619
I have marked all your holes, and they are now attended by watchmen

00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,880
who collect no bribes and applaud no dramatics.

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,400
..

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,510
The allister kept his poise even as the steel embraced him.

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,930
He looked at the room of the practice, licking to show it.

00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,930
Contempt of a man who has bought applause and knows its price.

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,840
And yet, as he passed Miss Hart,

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,099
I saw a flicker cross his eyes like the memory of some single kindness

00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,390
that had not been part of any plan.

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,920
Take him, Inspector. Mr. Holmes has done the art and you must do the craft.

00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,250
And when London reads of it, I shall print as little of the ladies as the truth permits,

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,000
for I am not in the business of breaking slippers in the street.

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,500
Then, Miss Hart, you are in the business of mending them, which is a rarer trade.

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,130
Come, Watson, we must see the Duchess, and return to her the liberty of her niece,

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,390
and the education of her household.

00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,059
After that, perhaps, I shall permit myself an heir upon the violin in D,

00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:02,359
D, which is the key of restorative conclusions.

00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,159
The Duchess of Ravenscar received us in her library

00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,220
with a composure that only magnified the tremor.

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,960
Of her hand upon the bell-pull,

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,679
Lady Beatrice hovered near like a penitent angel

00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,519
while servants came and went like discreet punctuation.

00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,920
The house seemed to exhale relief in the way.

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,300
Lambs do when their wicks are trimmed.

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,699
..

00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,900
Mr. Holmes, I have had news enough to make an old woman of me

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,090
and grace enough to keep me standing?

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,409
Is it done?

00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:34,730
And can the child sleep without dreaming of masks and staircases?

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,710
It is done, insofar as the principal actors have been bowed off,

00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,760
Sir Alistair Mordaunt and Colonel Moe.

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,909
Redaunt, no relations except in enterprise are at Scotland Yard,

00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,019
the ledger which threatened your peak.

00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,139
E will be safe from commerce.

00:38:53,139 --> 00:39:00,380
There remains only the reform of certain habits which invite rogues as cheese invites mice.

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,799
..

00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:08,940
Oh, sir, I am ashamed to the bone, and yet I confess I should not have learned caution had I not been endangered.

00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,320
If gratitude can mess shame, then I am free. If not, I shall bear it quietly.

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Holmes placed upon the table the counterfeit casket and beside it the crystal charm.

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:35,219
Now mated to its twin, which he had found among the Colonel's effects, the two together made a tiny parody of a pair of children's shoes, and I could not but reflect upon the childishness of grown persons when romance offers to escort them to ruin in a carriage drawn by adjectives.

00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:40,920
The charm bears a needle mark, your grace, which ties it indelibly to the ledger.

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,139
The same hand that thought to sign his trinkets signed his downfall.

00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:51,059
Let it remind the household that nothing is so dangerous as an original scoundrel.

00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:57,680
For originality flatters our vanity and so loosens the strings of our purse.

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,820
You have my thanks, Anne, if you will not be insulted by the word, my affection.

00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,980
And yet there is one debt I would pay more immediately.

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,860
A debt to this young woman who has been accused in my hearing of a carelessness she never practiced.

00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,720
...

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,690
Your Grace, I am sorry. I meant no harm.

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,369
I lend my ribbon to a lady who spoke kindly and I dreamed of the gallery.

00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,880
I shall speak less and dream harder if you forgive me.

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,519
Forgive her, Your Grace.

00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:35,000
She has learned truth faster than she would have learned fear.

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,219
..

00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:39,900
And that is the proper education of a servant as of a prince.

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,109
Miss Hart's curiosity was of the useful sort.

00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:48,000
If Alice had denied her ribbon, we should still be searching the wrong pockets.

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,059
Then I forgive and will say no more.

00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,369
Yet, Mr. Hunt, no.

00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:57,860
Combs, I must ask, what led you to the Colonel first,

00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,989
when there were any number of dandies who might have worn a silver mask and quoted a silly line.

00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:09,529
His gate, your grace, a military exactness softened by indulgence,

00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:16,890
the fox's head cane engraved in Bombay, thrown away as decoration by those who have never been,

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,699
the clean-shaven cheek where an Indian climate makes shaving a purgatory for the unpractised,

00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:30,789
and, most tellingly, a watcher's eyes that measured exits as a quartermaster measures crates.

00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:37,409
He was the only guest at the river who looked for a staircase before he looked for a star.

00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,329
The Duchess nodded.

00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,159
No, Huml, call it a sing.

00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,019
As people nod when they recognize wisdom they cannot administer yet,

00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,289
would gladly employ, and she excused herself to speak with Beatrice in private,

00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,539
Holmes and I took our leave, and in the cab he turned to me with

00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,159
that look which promises a lesson. If only I keep my vanity out of the way and my ears open.

00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:05,760
Watson, what did you observe about Miss Hart's entrance at the embankment that I did not mention

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,039
but nevertheless relied upon when I elected to trust her? She spoke as if she had foreknowledge

00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:18,739
of our positions, dire, and yet she did not signal to the watchers who fled. Perhaps her courage was

00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:24,079
too sincere for a conspirator's habits. Also, her shoes were wet at the toe, as if she had crossed

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,300
from a skiff and yet she came from the top. That suggested she had done more than approach. She had

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,820
already reconnoitered the stare and found it spoiled.

00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,000
..

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,440
Um, excellent, hmm.

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
..

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,019
My dear fellow, the wet toes spoke more loudly than her eloquence. And there was the ribbon

00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:47,639
clasp with soap we found earlier. They seldom sell those to men who blackmail ladies.

00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,890
all pointed to a woman of inquiry rather than of intrigue.

00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,630
Ah!

00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,690
We'll return to Baker Street where the kettle sang and the violin waited.

00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,210
He took it up and played so.

00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:57,750
Hmm.

00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,409
Heftly.

00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:58,739
Hmm.

00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,019
A series of notes that rose like childhood recollections

00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:03,719
and then fell at peace.

00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,880
He paused and smiled in that rare human way

00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,789
that makes him, for an instant,

00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,320
less a machine of logic

00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,970
and more the man who cherishes his friend.

00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,579
Do not despise these little dramas.

00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:15,320
Watson,

00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,320
They are the steam that drives the engine of human motive.

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:27,489
But I confess I prefer the clean click of a fact seated properly in its notch to the size of a duchess.

00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:34,409
The morning will bring newspapers, and we must prevent them from making a pantomime of our police.

00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:40,539
Speaking of newspapers, gentlemen, may a reporter trespass upon domestic felicity to return a ribbon

00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:44,179
to a conscientious maid and a debt of thanks to two men

00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:47,369
who keep London's masks from eating its faces?

00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,980
She stood at our door with the boldness peculiar to honest women

00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,880
who have chosen an immodest profess.

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,720
Yawn. Holmes bade her enter with the courtesy he never denies to merit.

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,430
She laid the ribbon upon our table as a soldier lays down a medal,

00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,260
lightly and with pride.

00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,230
I have written my piece.

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,639
It names no lady.

00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,199
It praises no villain.

00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,860
And it credits the police with all the craft

00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:15,449
and Mr. Holmes with all the art, if you object to the balance, I will rebalance to your taste,

00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:21,920
but I would rather keep my integrity than my post. Keep both. The truth is often more saleable than

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,739
the lie. When one can afford it, tell me, Miss Hart, who, why you took such risk as to dance

00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:35,360
on the very edge of the Colonel's watchfulness, without the comfort of a warrant to hold you

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,539
if you slipped. Because I am tired of reading tragedies in which the innocent are scolded

00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:51,510
and the clever are admired. For their cleverness I wished once to admire sense and scold wickedness,

00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:57,559
and if I may say so without impropriety, because I saw a Lady Beatrice, a girl whose foolishness

00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:03,400
resembled mine at seventeen, and I thought I could pay back a debt to a world that had been

00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,800
been unreasonably patient with me. Holmes listened gravely and then, in a gesture rare for him,

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,159
bowed as if to an equal on a field where the rules were unwritten. I felt in that moment a

00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:17,599
stirring of my own admiration that had less to do with the drama of the case and more to do with

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,840
the quiet heroism that occasionally flowers in the soil of London's ordinary streets.

00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,739
If you keep to that creed, you will be unpopular in certain circles and immortal in a few. Do not

00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:35,730
permit editors to subtract your courage with their blue pencils and fard.

00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:42,300
Watson, do remember that a deduction is only a kindness

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,160
when it saves someone pain more than it causes embarrassment.

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,470
He turned again to his violin and duos.

00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,960
Violin and, for a while in the room, held nothing but music

00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,579
and the faint crackle of the goal.

00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:02,309
outside, at, the city side and bent on being itself, surly, magnificent, credulous, cunning,

00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:06,519
until a rap at the downstairs door reminded us that reputation is a vigilant creditor

00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,659
and often demands payment when the peace is barely over.

00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:12,520
Hmm, Mr. Hmm, Holmes.

00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,059
Dop the tidings.

00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:19,430
Sir Alistair has attempted magnanimity, offering to name names if we would permit him discretion.

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,739
He underestimates the appetite of justice for such banquets.

00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:29,599
I thought you would like to know that our man intends to turn fairy godmother in his cell and conjure a pumpkin carriage for himself.

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:30,960
..

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,670
Decline his invitation.

00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:40,109
Lestrade, he will give you all without bargaining when he sees that his glitter has ceased to dazzle.

00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:48,650
Assure him that the one mercy the law extends to men like him is the mercy of procedure which is indifferent to charm.

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,639
As succinct as a warrant, Mr. Dodd.

00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:55,340
Holmes, I shall leave you to your music and your morals

00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,960
Good night, doctor, and nurse your shoulder

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,059
A cavalry cane leaves a bruise that enjoys its own company

00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,579
Lestrade departed, Miss Hart at his side

00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:07,239
To secure the dull particulars that make lively copy

00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,960
Holmes set down the bow and turned once more to me

00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,599
With that half-smile, which is his reward to my endurance

00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,199
And perhaps my only fee

00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:17,460
You executed your part well, Watson

00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,519
You closed with the colonel precisely at the syllable

00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:26,599
when rhetoric would have been fatal, I could not have done better myself. Though I might have done

00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:33,219
it earlier, which would have spoiled our evidence, and now, if you insist upon learning, you shall

00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:39,340
tell me what the two underlines in the note signified, besides the stair position.

00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,360
They signified, I believe, the presence of two watchers rather than one, and the necessity to

00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,219
occupy both with some rival spectacle, which Miss Hart provided simply by existing where she

00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:51,740
she ought not to have been.

00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,690
Admirable my dear fellow,

00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,710
you grow.

00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,159
Soon I shall be unemployed,

00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,430
or worse,

00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,119
celebrated beyond usefulness.

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,430
To bed now,

00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,679
and in the morning

00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,329
you may write your chronicle,

00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,019
which I shall not read,

00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:09,420
and yet somehow always respect.

00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,659
The days which followed

00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,059
had that curious quiet

00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,360
which overruns London

00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,099
after a public scandal has been.

00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,159
Neatly avoided,

00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,779
there is a silence made.

00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:18,940
I think,

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:32,619
By the absence of gossip that might have been, the Duchess sent a carriage of orchids with a note as restrained as an epitaph and Lady Beardress wrote to Miss Hart asking for a copy of the article in which no one was named and everyone was saved.

00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:33,740
..

00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,599
Observe, Watson, how the world is content to forget the very tragedies it thirsted to hear,

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,590
provided it may applaud its own discretion afterward.

00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:48,519
The public is a narrator who leaves out the inconvenient chapters

00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:51,000
and credits itself with the moral,

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,400
we, fortunately, are bound to a stricter memory.

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,599
..

00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,930
Sir Alistair, as Lestrade later informed us,

00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,139
confessed with a prolixity that would have done credit to a novelist

00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:07,760
paid by the line, the gunner remained staunch and sour, and sour, but his pockets gave up a great

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,750
many small instruments, which, connected together, made a school of deception so well equipped,

00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:18,400
that I marvelled we had caught it with so little injury. Your man sang, Mr. Holmes, in the bass of

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,360
a gentleman and the treble of a coward. He gave us names, accounts, and a list of future fetts he

00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,579
meant to harvest. For once I shall go to a ball to cancel it, and I will dance with every hostess

00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,099
to prove the police can turn better than a rogue.

00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:32,139
..

00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:34,369
Hey, dance with care.

00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:37,569
Lestrade, the law's toes are tender.

00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:40,219
And remember to send the Duchess her jewels

00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:43,420
after they have been stared at the proper length

00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,680
by the proper authorities.

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,510
Eee!

00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,400
For property loves admiration

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,369
almost as much as its owners do.

00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:54,720
I thought you might like to see the published piece.

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,019
And they...

00:49:56,019 --> 00:50:01,639
gentlemen i kept the headlines solemn and the ending neat i exercised to the full the right

00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:07,800
of the press not to ruin girls to demonstrate the vigor of its type he laid the paper upon our table

00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,559
with a modesty which showed her pride more becomingly than any pre said claim home scanned

00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,440
the column is smiling at the points where the facts were plain and at the places where art had

00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,420
softened fact with hope would bending it the city would read it over tea and feel immoral without

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,309
without being wounded, a rare conjunction.

00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:26,569
I don't mind you.

00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:30,639
You have told more truth by not telling all of it

00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,600
than many men manage in their confessions.

00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,579
Tick!

00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:35,960
..

00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,480
Resuccess is dangerous to the conscientious

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,869
because it tempts them to attempt two honest things at once.

00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:45,510
Do not try.

00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:50,099
For instance, to be just and witty upon the same line too often,

00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,529
the one will trip the other.

00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:57,849
I shall try, Mr. Holmes, to be merely kind and precise.

00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:03,059
As for wit, I have found it pleases most when it is suspected and not proved.

00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,860
And if your doctor friend will forgive a forwardness,

00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:11,230
I should be honoured if one day he would teach me how to read a bruise as he reads a pulse,

00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,329
for I suspect the city keeps its history upon human skin as much as in ledgers.

00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:19,639
I answered that if you truly wished to learn the dull art

00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:22,640
by which the living advertise their recent past,

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,820
I would gladly instruct her.

00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,269
And perhaps my eagerness betrayed something of the admiration which,

00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:29,619
if a man be honest,

00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,840
he must at times fiend for those who use their courage in public

00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,710
where he uses his privately.

00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:39,070
Watson will teach you the anatomy of consequences, Miss Hart and I.

00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,269
Since you have proved your discretion,

00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:43,399
we'll teach you the alphabet of traces.

00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:46,800
For the city is a text that rewards the literate.

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Between you both you may publish a grammar of rudence

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,760
But those who have none

00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,039
Gentlemen

00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:55,720
..

00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,340
Forgive a duchess who returns like a common petitioner

00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,219
I have come to deliver a letter that was meant for you

00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,619
But which found me first

00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,840
And I confess I opened it

00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,239
For I am too old for scruples

00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,880
When those I love are mentioned

00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,940
The letter folded and refolded

00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,960
until the creases declared impatience bore no seed.

00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,260
Hone slitted with his knife and read silently,

00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,360
the line between his brows deepening,

00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,019
not with alarm but with interest.

00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,519
It's insane, as a mathematician's might,

00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,269
when a problem turns delightful.

00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:30,539
From Sir Alistair, he begs,

00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,400
Now, he proposes,

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,820
a final act of magnanimity,

00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,109
that we allow him to return certain private letters,

00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:39,949
not yours, Duchess,

00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,719
but those of a lady he will not name,

00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:53,449
In exchange for our recommendation of leniency, he writes as a man who has mistaken my character for that of a manager who loves a neat curtain.

00:52:53,449 --> 00:53:06,239
Will you, can you, Mr. Rister, Holmes, persuade the law to be gentle where a woman's heart is concerned, provided that the man gives back what he stole and injures no one by his confession?

00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:13,220
I cannot persuade the law to be what it is not, Your Grace, but I can promise dact the law.

00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:20,720
When told the truth, does not relish injuring bystanders, I shall speak to Lestrade.

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,479
The letters will be returned, not as a bargain, but as an inevitability,

00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:30,199
and the sentence will be what sentences generally are,

00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:36,900
too heavy for the guilty in their own opinion, and too light for them in the opinion of the injured.

00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,739
Your word wed, Mr. Perg. Holmes, the letters are recovered. The judge will hear that the accused

00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:49,079
facilitated their return. As for leniency, I have learned to leave that to benches and to

00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:55,219
providence, and I sleep better when I do not advise either. Thus concluded the principal matter. The

00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:57,649
The city digested it as it digests all.

00:53:57,649 --> 00:53:59,720
With a brief fever and a long calm,

00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,409
yet for us, as often happens when the cotton drops,

00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,559
the real lesson began after the applause.

00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,329
And it was I who received it,

00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:09,119
with a humility not entirely common to my nature.

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,199
You remember, Watson, the tiny scratch upon the charm's door?

00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,269
You saw it, you noted it,

00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:17,239
but you did not at first ask yourself

00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:21,170
why any man would mark what he planned to scatter among many hands?

00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,659
The answer is vanity,

00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:31,099
which, I have observed, is the telegraph wire upon which detection travels quickest whenever

00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:35,840
a criminal stamps his authorship upon a thing without necessity.

00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,539
He offers us the courtesy of an autograph and a forwarding address.

00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:41,839
..

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,380
I said that I should endeavour henceforth to look for unnecessary flourishes, as if

00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,780
they were signposts, rather than decorations, and that I would prefix to each observation

00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:57,550
The question, why this? And why thus, which is in truth the catechism of all honest inquiry, whether in medicine or crime?

00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,359
You will make a detective of me yet, Watson.

00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:06,210
By insisting, I explain myself. When I am gone, the city will still be legible.

00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:09,869
And if you have learned the alphabet, you will not be lonely.

00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:12,409
Moreover, you will write. Aha!

00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:17,300
And the writing of honest chronicles is itself a form of rescue.

00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:23,340
cue. That evening, as if to bless our resolution, Mrs. Mrs. Hudson produced a pudding as virtuous

00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,829
as a sermon and as comforting as a mother's hand. Holmes ate little but praised it much,

00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:32,350
which is his way, and afterward he took up the violin and played not in D, as he had promised,

00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:37,239
but in G, a key with something of the heart in it, and I, hearing it, fancied that even the city

00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:42,719
nodded, content that for one night its fairy tales had learned their morals. Before I leave you to

00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:48,340
to your music, gentlemen. Permit me a last impertinence. I have heard said in newsrooms

00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,039
that for Mr. Holmes everything is elementary, and it is a phrase they use to belittle that

00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:59,109
which they do not understand. I believe it is the opposite, that everything is intricate,

00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:04,539
and that Mr. Holmes has the gift of untying the knots, which is not the same as pretending they

00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:11,440
were never tied. You flatter me in a new and therefore interesting way. Miss Hart, the truth

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,510
Truth is that complexity is the only luxury we permit ourselves when lives are at stake.

00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:22,719
And simplicity is the only courtesy we offer when we return those lives to themselves

00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,460
to make the complex elementary is a kind of surgery.

00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,300
And so I write this as surgeon and student.

00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,930
As friend and witness, the case of the Prince Charming left behind it,

00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:37,320
not broken slivers, but mended propensities as a, which is better.

00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,840
and if, in later years, I should mislay the exact contour of the colonel's car or the particular

00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,079
blint of the slipper's glass, I should not mislay the sound of Holmes's bow drawing from the strings

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,840
that patient, clarifying note with which he returns the city to its senses. Come, Watson,

00:56:53,840 --> 00:57:00,260
the night is honest again. Let us walk a little. Were the air has that early autumn crispness

00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:06,159
which pleases logic, and there is always the chance that a new visitor, perfumed with the

00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,900
promise of complication, is already ascending our stair.

00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,679
.
