00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
It was a calm winter morning and the faint golden light of the sun filtered into our sitting room at Baker Street,

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,300
illuminating the quiet chaos of books, newspapers and Holmes' chemical apparatus.

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,859
I had been attempting to follow an article in the Times,

00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:18,549
while Holmes, with his customary detachment, perused a slim monograph on rare gemstones.

00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:21,420
Hmm, look Watson, hmm.

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,600
Here lies an instructive example, an account of a jewel thief who failed because he ignored the simplest observation.

00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,200
You never cease to find lessons in these reports, Holmes,

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,150
yet what intrigues me is how you manage to reduce matters of the most bewildering complexity to mere trifles.

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,100
Elementary, my dear Watson.

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,479
A man must train his eyes to see and his mind to connect what others discard.

00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,219
..

00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,460
Complexity is but the mask of ignorance.

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,019
And yet, I confess, I am still struggling with that art.

00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:58,439
Every time I attempt to emulate you, I fall into error.

00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,060
That is precisely why I persist in your education, Watson.

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,079
Wysh is not contouring, it is discipline.

00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:14,030
Now observe, your boots carry faint traces of the reddish clay from yesterday's walk by the serpentine.

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,340
You did not notice it yourself, yet it speaks clearly to me.

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,580
By Jove, Holmes, I had not the slightest notion. You astound me every time.

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,019
And so, when a true mystery presents itself,

00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,040
the practice of noticing will serve us well.

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,780
..

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,170
Ah! Listen!

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,019
That is Mrs. Hudson's tread. She brings us a visitor.

00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:42,500
A gentleman to see you, Mr. Holmes, says it's urgent.

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,759
The visitor entered, a tall naval officer with weather-beaten features and a look of suppressed anxiety.

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,890
His uniform was impeccable, yet his gloved hands trembled slightly as he removed his cap.

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,819
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, forgive the intrusion.

00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,430
I am Commander James M. Watson.

00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,800
I am the artillery of Her Majesty's Navy.

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,379
I come on a matter of the gravest urgency concerning a jewel known as the Blue Water.

00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:10,269
Blue Water? I have heard whispers of that name. Pray enlighten us, Commander.

00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,159
The Blue Water is no ordinary jewel, gentlemen.

00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:20,590
It is a sapphire of extraordinary size and purity, long kept as a naval trust.

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,980
Yesterday, from a locked compartment aboard my ship, it vanished.

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,099
I am ruined if it is not recovered.

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,439
..

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,110
Holmes and I were seated in a handsome cab with Commander Illery.

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,079
See, the frost of that winter morning clung to the windows as we rattled toward the docks by the Thames.

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,370
I confess, my imagination was fired by the prospect.

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,840
A jewel of incalculable worth, a theft upon a naval vessel, and Holmes in his element.

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,959
..

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,090
Gentlemen, this is the Dauntless, my ship, and the scene of this deplorable theft.

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,530
Remarkable, Holmes!

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,379
The sheer order of a naval deck, yet within such order, a crime of the first magnitude.

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,159
Okay, and that, Watson, is the paradox which interests me.

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:11,969
A theft amidst perfect vigilance suggests either extraordinary cunning or internal collusion.

00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,319
I fear as much. The Blue Water was kept in the Captain's cabin, in a steel box with double locks.

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,290
Only I and the First Lieutenant had keys. Yet the box was found forced open this morning.

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,139
But surely, Holmes, that suggests a most limited field of suspects.

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,569
Commander Illery ushered us below deck, into the Captain's quarters, where the theft had occurred.

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:40,040
The cabin was orderly, almost austere, yet its every detail invited scrutiny under Holmes' searching gaze.

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,920
A crude instrument used, and in haste, this was no professional cracksman.

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,319
Note the rough scoring here, Watson, and the fragment of metal still lodged in the keyhole.

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,759
By heavens, Holmes, you perceive all this from a mere glance.

00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,939
A not a glance, Watson, an accumulation of small certainties.

00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:08,399
Observe the dust displaced on the carpet, scarcely disturbed elsewhere, but heavily pressed here.

00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,129
Someone note to ply his tool.

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,250
Then the thief must have acted in the night, when silence covered his efforts.

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,069
Just so. Yet why here, and why now? That is what we must uncover.

00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,509
Commander, who had access to this cabin?

00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:31,079
Only myself, the first lieutenant, and occasionally the ship's steward when bringing supplies.

00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,500
No one else would dare.

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,659
Commander Illery, pained with strain, wasted no time in summoning the two men under suspicion,

00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:43,000
Lieutenant Graves, his second-in-command, and the ship's steward, Mr. Finch.

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Holmes suggested that the mess hall would provide sufficient space and privacy for the examination.

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,439
With measured dread, we made our way along the polished corridors of the vessel until we emerged into that long chamber

00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,480
where officers took their meals.

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,129
Mr. Holmes, this is Lieutenant Graves, and here, Steward Finch, gentlemen, you will answer Mr. Mr.

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,210
Holmes, directly and fully.

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,660
Please be seated. I am less concerned with rank than with truths.

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,300
..

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,580
Narrating, I noted the contrast. The lieutenant, with an officer's stiff bearing and narrowed eyes,

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,060
and the steward, pale, twitching, visibly ill at ease, hums, with his piercing gaze,

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,939
seemed to weigh both men as one might examine specimens in a cabinet.

00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:33,480
Lieutenant Graves, let us begin. At what hour did you last see the jewels secure in the captain's safe?

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,920
Shortly after the evening round, sir. I verified the locks myself at half-past nine. The safe was undisturbed. Ah!

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,100
...

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,950
Steward Finch, when were you last in the cabin?

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,120
I? I brought wine for the captain's table at supper, sir. That was all. I never touched the safe.

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,909
The man seemed shaken.

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,350
Though whether from guilt or fear of authority, I could not tell.

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:04,149
Tell me, Finch, why do your boots bear traces of reddish clay, when we stand upon damp cobble and salt-stained planks?

00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,939
I went ashore yesterday, sir. Only briefly.

00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:19,680
Briefly? And yet the clay clings thickly. Not the trace of a fleeting step, but the imprint of a prolonged errand. Where precisely did you go?

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,980
To, to fetch tobacco, sir.

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,970
Near Coving Garden.

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,820
And you, Lieutenant? Did you observe Finch absent from the ship yesterday?

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,680
No, sir. To my knowledge, he never left.

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,879
That's false. I went ashore. I swear it.

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,060
..

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:48,939
Enough. The contradiction itself is valuable. Watson, note how truth resists alignment. The clay upon Finch's boots, the denial of Graves.

00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,259
One of them conceals more than he admits.

00:06:52,259 --> 00:07:04,980
The interrogation aboard the Dauntless left my mind in turmoil. Finch's trembling denials, the Lieutenant's stiff refusals, and Holmes's quiet absorption all seemed to form pieces of a puzzle whose outline I could barely perceive.

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:15,259
When, late in the afternoon, Holmes suddenly declared that we must return ashore at once, I pressed him for an explanation. But he offered only that enigmatic smile which told me nothing and promised everything.

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,389
Habs, may I not at least know where we hasten?

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:33,110
Patience, Watson. The clay upon Finch's boots was not of Coving Garden, nor of the Thames docks. It was from a garden soil unique to this quarter, red with iron. A careless slip betrayed him.

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,050
Then you believe Finch lied about his errand?

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,730
We entered the dim stairwell of the Nodging House.

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,740
You really we?

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,240
The air smelled of boiled cabbage and damp plaster, while the groan of old boards echoed beneath our seats.

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,240


00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,939
We walked down the steps. Holmes, with noiseless tread, led us upward until we reached a door faintly marked with the Steward's name.

00:07:51,939 --> 00:08:00,879
Ha! ha! Here lies the heart of our matter. Observe, Watson, the wooden box locked yet light in the hand.

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,649
Could it contain the blue water itself?

00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:12,310
Not so heavy, nor merely papers, perhaps correspondence. Yet even scraps of ink may speak louder than gems.

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,230
Here, letters in a foreign language.

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,120
The hand of the Lord.

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:23,860
Italian. And see, this seal of a pawnbroker in Clerkenwell. The Steward was entangled in debt.

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,709
Debt! Then perhaps he stole the gem to settle his obligations.

00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:40,960
Too crude for that. The forced lock. The clumsy entry. These do not speak of a desperate debtor. They speak of a decoy. The true hand is more disciplined.

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,080
Then you believe Finch is but a pawn?

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,480
That very evening, Holmes led us to Clerkenwell, where gas lamps glowed feebly upon shuttered shops.

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,990
At the corner stood the pawnbroker's establishment, mentioned in Finch's papers. Holmes, with quiet instructions, stationed us in shadow while he himself vanished inside.

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:09,200
Narrating, the minutes dragged. I felt my pulse quicken with every passing sound, until at last the shop-door creaked and a tall figure in naval greatcoat slipped within. Holmes's snare was closing.

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Graves, by heaven, it is he!

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:21,110
In all the adventures I shared with my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, few rivaled the tension of that fog-drenched night in Clerkenwell when Lieutenant Graves slipped into the pawnbroker's shop.

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,769
Bearing that fateful parcel, I felt the very air quiver with the weight of justice about to descend.

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:36,190
Watson, observe! The parcel's bulk, its manner of unfolding. Yes, there! The blue water gleams at last!

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,330
By heavens, it is the sapphire!

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,299
Now, Commander, your moment!

00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:44,940
I will confront your lieutenant and reclaim your honour!

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,399
Graves, you vile traitor! You dared betray the trust of the navy!

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,129
Ay, I only meant to hold it as collateral. The debts, my honour, was lost already.

00:09:53,129 --> 00:10:07,320
Hours later, safe within the familiar warmth of Baker Street, I pressed Holmes for a full account. The fire crackled in the grade, and the sapphire itself lay upon the table, casting a faint blue radiance, as if mocking the fog and shadows of the night's adventure.

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,170
Holmes, you must explain how you unravelled the tangle so swiftly.

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:33,410
It was all, my dear Watson, a matter of exclusion. The lock upon the safe was forced with crude haste, clearly to suggest a common thief. Yet Graves possessed both the knowledge and the opportunity. He contrived to leave false traces, and seized upon Finch's debts to deflect suspicion.

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,940
The red clay was the pivot.

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:45,329
Finch, indeed, bore it upon his boots. But it was not from Govent Garden, as he claimed. It belonged to the very street where he lodged.

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:53,859
Why, he lodged! The act, coupled with Graves's denial of Finch's absence, revealed collusion of silence and deceit.

00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,399
Then Finch was guilty of weakness, not of theft?

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,480
..

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,019
Precisely. Graves preyed upon Finch's desperation, using his room and debts as camouflage.

00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:12,509
Yet the lieutenant's own arrogance led him to the pawnbroker, where his hands betrayed him with the sapphire itself.

00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,440
And so the Bluewater is safe again, thanks to your science of deduction.

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,919
.
