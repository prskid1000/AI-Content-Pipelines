On a frosty morning in Baker Street, Dr. Watson, his face flushed from the bitter wind and his coat collar stiff with frozen breath, steps into 221B Baker Street, where Sherlock Holmes sits rigidly by the window, his long legs stretched across the Persian rug, gloved hands clasped around a cold teacup, his sharp eyes fixed intently on the frosted pane. To his right, a dark oak desk lies in disarray, its brass fittings gleaming faintly under the pale morning light filtering through the drawn drapes, while a half-finished case file rests atop it. At the center-left of the room, a gas lamp flickers beside a leather chair, its cracked leather seats still warm from recent use. The background-right reveals a narrow hallway leading to the staircase, where the wooden banister is dark with age and the wall sconces are dull brass. As Watson enters, the door creaks open slightly, allowing a sliver of frigid air. Suddenly, the heavy knock at the front door echoes through the room; Edward Faversham, a government clerk from the Home Office, stands rigidly in the doorway, his wool overcoat covered with snowflakes, his face pale and drawn, clutching a folded letter sealed with red wax. Behind him, the pale winter sky is visible through the frosted glass of the front window, its cold light casting long shadows across the floorboards. The air is thick with anticipation as Faversham speaks of the Crying Houset—a dilapidated manor on the outskirts of Islington where eerie wails echo every night at midnight—marking the start of a chilling investigation that will test both Holmes and Watson’s reason and courage.
