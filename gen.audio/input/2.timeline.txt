3.610000: It was a humid and rather languid summer afternoon in London,
4.550000: the sort that made the curtains of our Baker Street rooms hang heavy and motionless,
2.110000: as if exhausted by their own weight.
3.690000: I found myself seated opposite my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
3.420000: who was engrossed in a monograph on African tribal poisons
3.670000: that had arrived from the Royal Colonial Society only the previous night.
2.300000: Though accustomed to his wide range of interests,
2.770000: I could not ignore the curiosity that uncoiled within me
2.500000: each time he delved into yet another obscure subject.
3.880000: Perhaps, I thought, he was preparing for some unknown investigation.
2.710000: Or perhaps, given his peculiar temperament,
4.400000: he simply wished to guard his restless mind from the creeping threat of boredom.
2.100000: Hmm, Watson, hmm.
6.620000: You are gazing as though I had transformed into some curious exotic exhibit at the British Museum.
3.730000: If there is a question lingering in that mind of yours,
3.120000: you might do me the kindness of voicing it
4.160000: instead of letting it rattle about like an unsecured carriage wheel.
1.200000: ..
1.040000: Holmes, you misjudge me.
4.620000: I was simply wondering why you find yourself buried in treatises on African toxins.
4.200000: I confess the subject seems a trifle remote from our usual London affairs.
2.050000: Remote, yes.
2.520000: Irrelevant, certainly not.
6.050000: Knowledge, my dear Watson, is never remote to the mind that knows how to classify it.
7.600000: The universe is a vast cabinet of curiosities, and one never knows which drawer may be required at any moment.
5.780000: Is still, Holmes. One might assume a peaceful afternoon could be spent without fear of sudden intrigue.
5.160000: Assume nothing, Watson. Peace is merely the interval before the next disturbance.
6.100000: Holmes had barely concluded this remark when the sudden and sharp rap of the downstairs bell jolted.
1.580000: the stillness of our rooms.
3.930000: Mrs. Hudson's surprised exclamation drifted upward,
4.240000: followed by the rapid footsteps of someone ascending the stairs with urgent purpose.
1.570000: Holmes raised a single eyebrow,
4.780000: a subtle gesture I had come to interpret as the confirmation of his own prophetic remark.
1.060000: ..
4.920000: You see, Watson, one must never tempt fate by speaking of peaceful afternoons.
3.210000: A moment later, our visitor burst into the room.
3.790000: A tall, somewhat angular gentleman with the complexion of a man
2.190000: recently returned from warmer climates.
2.070000: His attire bore traces of hurried travel
1.370000: and in his trembling hands,
1.990000: he clutched a small wooden travel cage
1.390000: draped in a silk cloth.
1.040000: Even through the fabric,
1.570000: I could sense the faint shifting
1.590000: of something alive within.
3.410000: Mr. Holmes, thank heavens you are in.
2.380000: I was told that if any man in London
1.170000: could prevent a catastrophe,
1.150000: it would be you.
1.260000: I beg of you,
2.010000: accept my apologies for the intrusion,
3.180000: but I have had no peace these past 48 hours.
1.980000: Pray calm yourself, sir.
1.520000: Whom's at your service?
4.190000: And this is my friend and chronicler, Dr. Karnicler.
2.180000: ...
5.940000: John Watson, may I ask your name and the cause of this evident distress?
1.040000: ..
4.850000: My name is Captain Reginald Harrington of the colonial forces stationed on the Gold Coast.
5.450000: And this, this cursed creature has brought nothing but misery since I left Africa.
1.160000: ..
2.000000: The captain removed the silk cloth from the cage,
14.020000: ...............
7.540000: This is Kimboo, an African grey-breasted parrot, a gift or rather an inheritance of sorts from
3.340000: a local chieftain who died under violent circumstances.
7.120000: Before his death, he pressed the bird into my hands and muttered something about it being the key to the injustice.
5.120000: Since my return to London, I have been followed, threatened and nearly run down at the docks.
7.040000: And last night, someone attempted to break into my residence, ignoring all valuables and searching only for this bird.
1.200000: ..
4.980000: Fascinating! And what, pray tell, does the bird do that commands such a determined pursuit?
5.980000: suit? It speaks, Mr. Holmes, or rather it repeats a phrase in the chieftain's native language.
5.760000: The locals believed the bird had witnessed a crime. I dismissed it as superstition until the threats
5.720000: began. Holmes leaned forward, his piercing grey eyes glinting with unmistakable interest, the
4.620000: fingers of his steeple hands pressing together with the impatience of a mind already assembling
1.090000: assembling possibilities.
2.870000: Watson, observe the plumage.
2.330000: No ordinary African parrot.
4.820000: Its species is known for remarkable mimicry.
3.620000: Captain, repeat the phrase it utters.
2.030000: I cannot, Mr. Holmes.
3.670000: The language is unfamiliar and the pronunciation eludes me.
1.760000: But perhaps, Kimu?
2.500000: The captain tapped the cage gently.
4.610000: The parrot fluffed its feathers, glanced suspiciously around the room, and then croaked a guttural
5.060000: series of syllables, each pronounced with eerie clarity. The sound lingered with an unsettling
4.460000: effect, as though conveying some grave warning rather than a mere echo of human speech.
3.520000: Holmes, I cannot fathom what that means. Have you any notion?
8.560000: Several, Watson, though none yet verified. Captain Harrington, when precisely did the threats begin?
5.240000: Two nights after my ship docked, at first, anonymous notes slipped under my door,
2.240000: then whispered warnings on the street,
3.050000: and last evening the attempted break-in.
5.280000: I have every reason to believe someone is desperate to silence this bird.
4.070000: Or retrieve what the bird represents.
2.810000: The thief ignored other valuables, you say?
3.880000: Then this is no random intimidation.
6.350000: This is a targeted pursuit driven by knowledge or fear of what the parrot knows.
6.220000: I observed Holmes rise from his chair and move toward the window with the graceful precision of a whoop.
0.290000: Hmm.
0.940000: Anting feeling.
0.550000: Hmm.
3.130000: He opened the curtain slightly and scanned the street below.
0.840000: Watson.
0.430000: Hmm.
6.930000: Do you note the black mustached fellow leaning against the lamppost on the opposite side of the street?
0.400000: Hmm.
0.570000: No?
0.740000: Hmm.
1.320000: Observe carefully.
5.100000: His boots bear fresh mud, inconsistent with London's pavements,
4.240000: and his coat shows the red dust of the western docks.
5.100000: He has looked up at our windows three times since the captain entered.
3.800000: Holmes, I swear the man seems inconspicuous to my eyes.
3.570000: Naturally. Observation, Watson, is seeing.
2.740000: Deduction is understanding what one sees.
5.000000: You must train your mind not merely to look, but to perceive.
3.300000: I promise you, Holmes, I am always trying.
2.020000: A commendable effort.
7.720000: Now, Captain Harrington, has anyone besides yourself handled this parrot since your departure from Africa?
5.890000: Only the chieftain's son, shortly before he passed, and a merchant at the docks who helped secure the cage.
3.010000: But neither could have instigated all this.
5.590000: We shall see. Tell me of the chieftain. You said he died violently?
1.120000: ..
5.880000: Yes, an ambush. His tent was raided. Many believed he was murdered by a rival tribe.
3.870000: Others whispered of white traders seeking to control ivory roots.
3.100000: But before he died, he insisted Kimbo had seen the two-killer.
4.200000: He was half delirious, but intensely insistent.
5.030000: A witness, but not a human one. Remarkable.
3.800000: Holmes turned to me with that rare electric spark of excitement,
3.880000: which indicated that a case worthy of his intellect had at last arrived.
4.540000: Watson, I believe our peaceful afternoon has concluded.
5.860000: Captain Harrington, allow me to assure you, you have come to the correct place.
2.460000: But you must not return home tonight.
1.120000: ..
1.350000: Then where shall I go?
4.080000: You will remain here at Baker Street.
2.090000: Watson and I shall keep watch.
5.620000: Watch, whoever pursues this bird will not abandon their efforts quietly.
1.360000: ..
3.480000: Holmes, you cannot mean to invite danger into our chambers?
3.400000: Watson, danger is already waiting outside
5.900000: and it would be inhospitable to keep it lingering in the street
4.850000: or better to confront it on ground we control.
3.210000: Holmes then approached the cage and addressed the parrot directly.
5.600000: Now then, my feathered informant, let us hear your secret again.
4.560000: Speak, Kimbul, and let us unmask the shadow that follows you.
2.620000: ...
3.000000: The parrot stared at Holmes with an uncanny intensity,
1.940000: then repeated the strange phrase,
3.630000: its voice resonating through the room like a cryptic prophecy.
3.030000: And at that moment, though I did not yet understand why,
5.080000: a chill crept up my spine, warning me that this case would draw us deep into a perilous mystery
5.060000: tree that stretched far beyond the borders of London. The evening deepened into one of those
4.620000: heavy London nights where the fog presses against the windowpane, unease like a living creature,
5.300000: who, muffling the outside world until it seems a distant dream, Holmes had extinguished all but
5.030000: one lamp, allowing shadows to settle along the edges of the room in silent, watchful folds.
4.670000: Captain Harrington sat stiffly on the sofa, his very eyes flickering toward the cage each time
4.300000: the parrot shifted its weight or rustled its feathers. As for myself, I could not deny a
4.400000: drawing apprehension, though I attempted to conceal it beneath the surface of calm professionalism
1.780000: expected of a medical man.
4.130000: Watson, I trust you have loaded your service revolver.
4.810000: I suspect we shall need a deterrent, though ideally not a fatal one.
4.300000: Holmes, the pistol is prepared, though I sincerely hope its presence proves unnecessary.
5.170000: Hope, Watson, is a luxury one may carry in one's inside pocket.
2.610000: Prudence, however, I keep hosted.
4.570000: stood. Holmes moved with his characteristic quiet precision, checking the locks on the windows,
4.760000: the latches on the doors, and even the faint tracks of footprints upon our wooden floorboards,
4.970000: although I could hardly imagine how such details would assist him considering that no one had yet
5.460000: entered. Still, his thoroughness was oddly reassuring. Mr. Holmes, I cannot shake the
5.160000: fear that Kimball's presence here puts you both in danger. I did not intend to entangle you in
1.070000: in a colonial feud.
2.590000: Captain Harrington, I assure you,
3.040000: danger is an old acquaintance of ours.
1.400000: It visits frequently
2.940000: and seldom requires an invitation.
2.190000: The parrot let out a soft whistle,
1.880000: then hopped twice on its perch.
1.550000: Its beady eyes glimmered
1.540000: with that same inexplicable intelligence
1.780000: that had unsettled me earlier.
1.450000: Horns leaned toward the cage,
2.170000: observing the bird with a scientist's fascination
2.660000: mixed with the detector's sharp suspicion.
2.700000: Watson, do you recall the phrase
1.370000: it spoke earlier?
2.510000: Holmes, the sounds were so foreign to my ear
2.180000: that I fear I could not replicate a single
0.870000: syllable.
3.070000: Just so. Yet the pattern of intonation
2.010000: was unmistakably deliberate.
1.730000: There is information
2.460000: encoded there. Not a mere
2.180000: mimicry, but a recounting.
1.620000: And that is what
1.760000: our adversary fears.
2.220000: Holmes, surely you do not
2.330000: believe the parrot actually witnessed a murder?
0.630000: Believe?
1.500000: No, Watson.
1.060000: ..
0.710000: Deduce?
1.080000: Yes.
4.750000: The bird is a recorder, an observer, a living phonograph of the bush.
4.790000: If the chieftain died in its presence, whatever words were last spoken,
5.560000: whatever argument transpired, those may be preserved in this creature's memory.
3.300000: Mr. Holmes, the chieftain's dying words were frantic.
4.570000: He spoke of betrayal, of a secret hidden in plain sight.
3.600000: I thought it the ramblings of a delirious man.
1.320000: ..
4.760000: Delirium may veil truth, Captain, but it does not negate it.
3.110000: A sudden tapping at the window started Harrington,
3.940000: who leapt to his feet with the agitation of a man long pursued.
2.600000: Holmes, however, merely gestured for quiet,
2.910000: his expression sharpening like a blade being honed.
2.780000: Watson, step slightly to the left.
2.000000: Captain, do not approach the window.
1.420000: ..
2.640000: Our guest below seems restless.
3.300000: Forcing myself to steady my nerves, I shifted position.
3.410000: Holmes slipped silently to the curtain and parted it but a fraction.
5.010000: He observed for a long moment, then allowed the drape to fall back into place.
4.020000: Our lamppost friend is still at his post.
5.640000: And now, accompanied by another, the situation escalates.
2.280000: ...
2.580000: Holmes, are they merely watching or preparing?
6.140000: Both. A man who watches too long will eventually act to justify his vigilance.
1.240000: ..
3.800000: Holmes, if they mean to retrieve the bird, then we must.
2.700000: We shall do nothing hasty, Captain.
2.680000: The game of pursuit and concealment is won.
2.510000: I prefer to play on my own terms.
3.950000: It was then that Kimboo suddenly erupted into a flurry of agitation,
2.310000: wings thrashing against the bars of the cage.
2.790000: The parrot's eyes darted widely about the room
3.120000: as though sensing some unseen presence creeping closer.
2.170000: Ah, the mood shifts.
1.050000: Soup!
2.130000: Holmes, what does this mean?
4.330000: It means, Watson, that Kimboo is accustomed to danger
2.960000: and recognizes when it draws near.
2.360000: I moved instinctively closer to Harrington
2.770000: who seemed ready to bolt at the slightest provocation.
2.190000: Holmes, however, remained notably calm
2.630000: as he crossed the room and extinguished the last lamp.
2.270000: The chamber fell into near total darkness
2.880000: with only the faint shimmering glow of the street lamps
1.780000: filtering through the fog outside.
0.890000: Sink!
2.270000: Gentlemen, stand still.
2.040000: Allow your eyes to adjust.
4.120000: A dark room is less inviting to trespassers
4.170000: and far more revealing to those who know how to listen.
2.310000: Several dance minutes passed in silence,
2.240000: broken only by the occasional rustle of wings
1.660000: as Kimbu shifted nervously.
4.930000: Then from somewhere just beyond our door came the unmistakable sound of a quiet footfall.
5.930000: Not the polite step of Mrs. Hudson, but the careful predatory tread of someone attempting to mask their presence.
5.640000: My pulse quickened and I cast a glance toward Holmes, though the dimness rendered him little more than a silhouette.
1.280000: ..
4.850000: Watson, revolver ready, but do not fire unless absolutely necessary.
5.510000: A wounded intruder answers more questions than a dead one.
1.500000: Understood, Holmes.
2.380000: Dear God, they've come for me.
1.100000: ..
3.320000: Silence, Captain. Your fear is louder than your voice.
1.380000: ..
1.930000: The door latch gave a subtle metallic click.
5.480000: Slow, deliberate, a gloved hand formed a shadow against the glass panel above the handle.
5.070000: Holmes moved like a phantom, placing himself to the side of the entryway, invisible to anyone entering.
5.020000: Watson, the moment they cross the threshold, illuminates the room.
2.480000: Harrington, remain behind me.
2.200000: ...
2.640000: Before I could reply, the intruder forced the door open.
4.500000: A hooded figure slipped inside, his movements swift, practiced and utterly silent.
3.070000: Another shadow loomed behind him, obscured in the corridor.
3.050000: They scanned the darkness as though attempting to locate the cage.
3.700000: The bird, it must be here. Find it before he wakes.
5.930000: I nearly laughed aloud at the absurdity of their assumption that Holmes would be asleep during such.
4.750000: A moment, but I contained myself, waiting for the signal.
3.410000: Hmm. Now, Watson. Hmm.
1.710000: I started the gas lamp.
4.720000: The room erupted into sudden brightness and the intruder's recoil as though seared by its radiance.
4.440000: Gone, one attempted to flee but Holmes seized him with astonishing speed, forcing him to the ground.
4.290000: Second intruder, the one from the corridor, made a desperate grab for the pallet's cage.
2.270000: Stop. Step away from the bird.
3.280000: Out of my way, doctor. The bird speaks death.
1.960000: ..
1.240000: Watson, restrain him.
5.340000: him. I lunged forward, knocking the man off balance. He stumbled, overturning a side table
5.560000: with a clash. Kimu shrieked violently, flapping its wings in terror. We cannot let the creature
6.710000: live. It knows. It knows. Knows what, my good fellow? And whom does it incriminate?
7.010000: You cannot make me speak. You cannot. Hones was already upon him, pinning his arm behind his back
1.360000: with precise efficiency.
2.270000: Harrington, trembling but determined,
2.400000: stepped forward as though ready to assist.
2.370000: Holmes, is he one of the traders?
1.500000: I recognize the accent.
2.100000: These men followed us in Africa.
1.690000: Indeed, Captain.
2.350000: Quite the persistent sort.
2.100000: Dow! I am Mew!
2.500000: The first intruder struggled beneath Holmes' grip
1.430000: but was firmly subdued.
2.730000: The second glared at me with wild, fevered eyes
2.000000: that practically glowed with desperation.
6.480000: If the bird repeats the chieftain's final accusation, we are doomed. All of us.
4.100000: .....
4.580000: Fascinating. So the chieftain named his murderer, did he?
4.220000: Never. I said nothing of the sort. I...
3.340000: On the contrary. You said quite enough.
4.000000: Holmes turned to me, his expression filled with that unmistakable spark of triumph.
6.420000: triumph. Watson, I believe our case has found its first solid footing. Bind them securely.
5.480000: There is much to learn, and dawn will bring no shortage of revelations.
1.320000: ..
6.890000: And indeed, as I tied the intruders with my medical bandages, the sturdiest material at hand,
4.050000: I could not help but feel that we had only scratched the surface of a far deeper and
4.420000: darker secret. Kimball groped softly from his cage, as though confirming the unsettling truth
1.970000: that more danger yet lay ahead.
3.770000: At the first dew of dawn crept through the fog like a timid intruder
1.900000: seeking permission to enter Londo.
4.100000: And its pale light softened the outlines of Baker Street,
3.080000: dimly illuminating the aftermath of the previous night's chaos.
3.040000: Our two mysterious assailants sat bound to sturdy chairs
1.420000: in the corner of our sitting room,
2.270000: glowering beneath their lowered brows.
3.120000: Captain Harrington paced near the hearth with restless energy,
2.110000: lancing periodically at the parrot's cage
2.820000: as though expecting it to erupt into further calamity.
3.420000: Holmes, in stark contrast to all of us, appeared invigorated.
2.640000: The night's events had clearly sharpened his intellect,
2.790000: like the whetstone that awakens a dormant blade.
3.420000: Watson, kindly pour yourself a cup of coffee.
3.500000: You appear as though sleep has become a stranger to you.
3.320000: Holmes, after wrestling ruffians, guarding exotic birds,
3.770000: and anticipating further danger, I must say rest did not come easily.
1.040000: ..
2.920000: Nonsense, Watson. You performed admirably.
8.290000: A lesser man might have fainted during last night's excitement, yet here you stand, only slightly bedraggled.
5.070000: I appreciate the compliment, though I suspect it is delivered with your customary irony.
6.640000: Not at all. Even iron gates require hinges. You keep our endeavours balanced.
6.100000: Harrington approached Holmes with a determined expression, his military posture stiff or tinged with vulnerability.
2.940000: Mr. Holmes, we must question them.
2.000000: Surely they will reveal who sent them
3.360000: and what they seek to prevent the world from learning.
1.750000: Patience, Captain.
3.950000: A hurried interrogation yields tangled answers.
2.260000: A careful one unravels truth.
1.920000: ..
2.920000: The parrot, Kimboo, voiced the sharp squawk,
2.080000: a sound halfway between alarm and impatience
2.430000: as though objecting to the delay of its own tale.
1.390000: Holmes turned toward the cage
2.730000: with the air of a conductor addressing his soloist.
6.160000: Kim Boo has a part to play, but its performance must be properly orchestrated.
2.990000: Holmes crossed to the corner where the two captives remained.
5.330000: He studied their faces, rough, weather-beaten, and marked with the unmistakable signs of colonial hardship.
5.970000: Their clothing bore traces of red dust, and one man's boots betrayed recent exposure to African soil.
3.320000: Gentlemen, you arrived in London less than a week ago.
7.100000: judging from your attire and the distinctive dust on your boots dust native to the region
7.100000: near the Volta river basin you were very recently on the gold coast you know nothing detective
8.680000: you cannot prove where we come from I do not prove I deduce and deduction requires only what
6.540000: is evident to any man with eyes and intellect in equal proportion unfortunately you appear in
1.250000: in short supply of both.
2.210000: I could not suppress a small smile.
2.140000: Holmes delivered such barbs with a precision
1.180000: that rivaled his vai.
0.430000: Hmm.
0.730000: Or Lin Bao.
0.620000: Hmm.
3.550000: Now, let us discuss matters plainly.
1.200000: We will say nothing.
1.150000: Nothing at all.
1.710000: You already have.
2.580000: Last night, in your desperation,
3.780000: you uttered the most damning clue of all,
3.070000: that the parrot knows the truth of a murder.
3.140000: I require no confession from you.
5.970000: The bird speaks nonsense, nonsense and curses.
5.800000: Curses? No. Linguistic fragments of a dying tongue? Quite possibly.
3.720000: Holmes moved to his desk and retrieved a thick leather-bound volume,
3.570000: a dictionary of regional Africa, and dialects,
4.980000: the hassle of which he had apparently studied with great interest over the years.
1.480000: Harrington looked astonished.
4.130000: Holmes, I had no idea you were so familiar with those languages.
4.240000: A detective never knows which tongue might whisper the final clue.
2.650000: Watson, bring the cage closer.
2.390000: I lifted Kimbu's cage with care,
4.460000: though the bird's sharp gaze made me feel as though I were being judged for every movement.
2.560000: As I positioned the cage on the table before Holmes,
2.870000: Kimbu ruffled his feathers with a haughty sort of dignity.
4.590000: Now then, Kimbu, let us hear what you have stored away.
2.210000: Holmes tapped lightly on the cage.
2.500000: Kimbu straightened and uttered a low, rhythmic phrase,
2.870000: the same guttural sequence we had heard the previous day,
2.160000: though now with more force and urgency.
2.360000: Holmes repeated the sounds under his breath,
2.080000: comparing them to the entries in the dictionary.
1.570000: Watson, listen closely.
1.020000: ..
3.550000: These syllables correspond to a dialect used in the northern territories,
2.970000: rarely spoken outside certain chieftain plans.
1.720000: ..
1.960000: Can you translate it, Holmes?
1.350000: Almost.
3.990000: The phrase is fragmented, but the structure is unmistakable.
5.240000: It sounds like he who comes with white hands brings death
5.280000: Or possibly the white-handed man kills the chief
1.060000: ..
2.960000: White-handed? You mean a foreigner? A European?
1.420000: ..
0.800000: Precisely
3.960000: And the phrase is repeated with remarkable consistency
3.900000: Suggesting it was spoken at a moment of urgency
4.790000: Likely during or immediately before the chieftain's death
4.030000: Lies! The bird lies! Parrots do not know truth.
1.160000: ..
4.180000: Parrots know what they hear, and they repeat what haunts them.
7.740000: This bird was present during the murder or, at the very least, near enough to hear the accusation.
7.100000: Holmes leaned closer to the captives. For a moment, silence stretched thin and taut across the room like the string of Holmes's violin.
6.850000: Tell me, who among the colonial traders is known by the name White Hand?
3.450000: A nickname perhaps? A moniker used by locals?
1.140000: ..
1.960000: We, we know no such man.
3.920000: Another lie. Your reaction is too swift, too rehearsed.
3.140000: I will ask again, who bears that name?
4.720000: You think us fools, detective? You think we will betray our employers so easily?
6.380000: I do not require your cooperation. The evidence will reveal itself in due course.
1.380000: ..
2.520000: Holmes returned to the parrot and tapped the cage again.
4.170000: Kimbo repeated the phrase, then added another set of syllables I had not heard before.
4.300000: Harsher, more clipped, delivered with a strange trembling of the bird's wings.
3.670000: Ah, there is more, there is more.
5.760000: The second phrase, yes, it resembles the local word for ivory and perhaps river.
8.280000: hand betrayal homes could he be naming a location a route more likely describing
5.680000: an illicit trade operation one that someone wished to keep hidden perhaps
5.100000: even from the chieftain himself the captive stiffened confirming Holmes's
3.540000: suspicion without uttering a single word Holmes observed them with the detached
6.480000: calm of a surgeon watching involuntary reflexes there it is your guilt betrays
6.560000: You understand nothing of the politics of the Gold Coast, Detective. Nothing.
9.240000: On the contrary. I understand that greed knows no language barriers and murder recognizes no borders.
5.180000: Combats. Just then, Mrs. Hudson entered, clutching her telegram in her flustered hands.
5.740000: Mr. Holmes, this arrived for you just now. The boy said it came from the foreign office. Urgent.
3.090000: Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
4.780000: Holmes snapped open the telegram with swift fingers, scanned its contents,
3.250000: and his expression hardened like wet clay left in the sun.
2.100000: Gentlemen, we have confirmation.
1.120000: ..
4.830000: The Foreign Office reports that a lieutenant, Colonel Rupert Ashcombe,
6.970000: known among the locals as the White Hand, arrived in London two days before Captain Harrington.
5.830000: He is wanted for questioning in connection with unauthorized ivory operations.
4.940000: Ashcombe. Impossible. He was respected. Decorated.
3.470000: Decorations have often concealed darker stains.
1.260000: ..
5.280000: It appears we now know the identity of the man our intruders serve.
1.100000: ..
3.020000: You know nothing. You cannot reach him. He is protected.
1.400000: ..
5.510000: Protected, perhaps, but not invisible, and certainly not innocent.
3.270000: The parrot screeched loudly, hobbing back and forth on its perch.
0.780000: And you!
4.240000: As though urging us to move without delay, Holmes stroked his chin thoughtfully.
2.200000: And that's la, fully...
2.530000: Watson, Hannington, prepare yourselves.
3.970000: The time has come to confront Lieutenant Colonel Ashcombe.
5.340000: The final act of this drama will not unfold here in Baker Street.
2.700000: ...
4.300000: No, it will unfold wherever Ashcombe hides his secrets.
3.820000: And though I could not yet foresee the dangers awaiting us,
3.550000: I felt the unmistakable thrill of the chase warming my blood.
4.920000: The mystery had deepened, and Holmes, with the parrot Kimboo as our unlikely guide,
2.630000: was ready to pursue its darkest thread.
4.160000: London's midday fog had thinned by the time we reached Blattfriars Wharf,
4.480000: yet a chill wind swept across the river with the insistence of an unwelcome reminder
4.120000: that danger lingered close. Holmes strode ahead of Captain Harrington and myself
4.940000: with purposeful haste, his long coat billowing like a banner heralding the charge of a lone
5.400000: general. Himmu, the African parrot, accompanied us within a larger travel gauge, pursed indignantly
4.310000: and occasionally muttering the ominous fragments it had recited in Baker Street.
5.190000: That creature's uncanny repetition felt increasingly like the refrain of a prophecy,
2.470000: drawing us nearer to its fulfillment.
3.790000: Watson, keep a sharp eye on our surroundings.
5.910000: Ashkund is not the sort to sit idly when his schemes are threatened.
2.990000: Holmes, I dare say that after last night's encounter,
3.400000: I am unlikely to miss even the rustling of a rat.
3.020000: Even rats can be deceiving, Watson.
2.040000: Many a villain is passed unnoticed
5.980000: because he disguised himself less as a predator and more as a pest.
5.360000: Harrington carried the cage with both hands, his military bearing stiffened with anxiety.
3.030000: Mr. Holmes, are you certain Ashkoomba is here?
3.290000: The foreign officer said he was staying at a club near Whitehall.
1.060000: ..
6.340000: Men whose hands are stained with betrayal seldom linger in respectable places.
5.540000: Trust me, Captain, the docks conceal more truth than London's parlours ever will.
5.700000: The wharf was a sprawling mess of crates, tar-stained ropes and the pungent scent of the thimbs.
4.520000: Labourers shouted, pulleys droned, gulls circled overhead with shrill cries,
3.450000: the kind of commotion in which a fugitive might vanish entirely,
2.740000: or from which an ambush might easily spring.
4.060000: There, the warehouse marked with the ivory emblem.
2.930000: Discretion was never Ashcombe's strong suit.
1.160000: ..
3.600000: Holmes pointed toward a large structure of soot-blackened brick.
4.600000: Its faded signage depicted a tusk-like shape partially obscured by grime,
4.050000: even from a distance. A sense of illicit secrecy emanated from it.
4.230000: Harrington's jaw tightened as the sight stirred some painful recognition.
5.920000: That symbol, Holmes, Holmes. That's the mark used by the traders suspected of smuggling ivory
3.960000: along the Volta. I encountered it years ago during an inquiry.
1.600000: ..
6.020000: Precisely. Ashcombe believes himself clever, but his confidence is merely arrogance in disguise.
5.080000: guys. The three of us approached cautiously. The warehouse doors were ajar, allowing a thin
4.360000: beam of sunlight to pierce the otherwise murky interior. Combs motioned for silence as he stepped
4.750000: inside. I followed, revolver in hand, while Harrington drawed the cage with measured steps.
4.730000: Watson, remain alert. If Ashcombe is here, he will not greet us with hospitality.
1.100000: ..
5.140000: The interior of the warehouse was dim, with rows of crates stacked like the rows of some crude
4.960000: cathedral lit only by flickering shafts of dusty light. The air carried the bitter smell of
4.360000: preservatives, wood shalings and something else, something metallic, though faint.
7.150000: Holmes, do you smell that? It's iron. Blood, Watson. Very faint, but unmistakable.
7.470000: Blood? Whose blood? Possibly the blood of anyone who has gotten too close to Ashkum's secrets.
2.720000: ...
3.420000: As the horn queued, a soft clatter echoed in the far corner,
2.270000: followed by the scurrying of hurried footsteps.
2.430000: Holmes dashed forward with feline spiffness,
5.350000: brushing aside a crate and revealing a narrow passageway leading deeper into the warehouse.
3.240000: Come, the quarry flees.
3.530000: We pursued him into a low-lit corridor lined with more crates,
1.940000: some marked with official stamps,
2.440000: others bearing illicit symbols of trade networks.
4.010000: works, Harrington nearly tripped on a discarded length of rope but recovered quickly.
4.750000: Holmes, the markings. Some of these grades came directly from Ashanti territories.
1.620000: ..
3.240000: Precisely why Ashkoon cannot allow us to leave?
4.460000: Suddenly, a voice rang out from the shadows ahead, smooth, commanding,
3.330000: tinged with the confidence of a man accustomed to unquestioned authority.
5.050000: Mr. Holmes, you have a talent for meddling where your presence is neither wanted nor wise.
8.830000: A figure emerged from behind a crate, tall, impeccably dressed, with silvering temples and a cold smile that suggested both charm and cruelty.
9.790000: His boots bore the same red dust stains Holmes had previously noted, a telltale sign of recent travel to the very African territories at the heart of this affair.
8.260000: Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Ashcombe, or rather the White Hand, as you are known to those whose trust you exploited.
3.900000: A childish nickname by superstitious natives, nothing more.
4.020000: On the contrary, it is a title earned and won.
3.060000: The chieftain spoke as he lay dying.
1.020000: ..
3.830000: Nonsense! You cannot expect me to tremble before the ravings of a dying man.
4.260000: Kimu, as though recognizing the man's voice with instinctive dread,
3.930000: had flapped violently within the cage, shrieking its haunting phrase.
2.390000: Harrington struggled to maintain his grip.
2.130000: Holmes, the bird, it's terrified of him.
5.900000: An honest witness will often display more courage than a deceitful man.
1.320000: ..
3.460000: Holmes, I invite you to leave immediately. That verdict was never meant to survive.
7.270000: As Ashcombe stepped closer, I noticed the glint of a revolver conceded beneath his coat, its barrel catching a sliver of light.
2.950000: Watson, to your left. He's reaching for the weapon.
3.330000: Before I could react, Ashcombe drew the revolver and fired.
5.580000: The shot rang out with deafening force, splintering a crate inches from my head.
2.670000: Holmes, he means to kill us.
2.450000: Watson, flank him.
3.720000: Ashcombe, for God's sake, stand down.
3.440000: Oh, I warned you, Harrington. Some secrets are worth any price.
5.260000: Holmes leapt sideways with remarkable agility, closing the distance between himself and Ashcombe.
3.840000: Another shot fired, ricocheting dangerously close to Harrington.
5.050000: Kimbu screeched with such ferocity that the warehouse seemed to echo with the chieftain's dying accusation.
1.000000: ..
1.510000: Watson, now.
4.120000: I lunged forward, grabbing Ashkum's weapon hand and wrenching it aside.
5.140000: The revolver discharged a final time, the bullet embedding itself harmlessly in the wooden floor.
6.390000: Though Ashkum fought with surprising strength, delivering a brutal blow to my ribs that sent me stumbling backward.
3.520000: You fools! You have no idea what this bird knows.
4.530000: On the contrary, Ashkum, I know precisely what it knows.
2.790000: Holmes seized Ashkum's arm with expert precision,
2.480000: whisking it until the revolver clattered to the ground.
2.990000: The colonel droned in pain but continued to struggle.
4.420000: Harrington dropped the cage and rushed to assist, tackling Ashkum around the waist.
3.310000: You murdered him. You murdered the chieftain.
1.040000: ..
1.800000: He would have exposed everything. I had no choice.
1.260000: ..
6.600000: There is always a choice. Yours was greed and the blood of an innocent man stains your hands.
3.460000: With combined effort, we pinned Ashkum to the ground.
5.030000: Hong secured his arms behind his back with a length of rope scavenged from a nearby crate.
6.600000: The defeated Colonel lay gasping, his once imperious expression replaced by the hollow gaze of a man whose empire had crumbled.
3.220000: Holmes, if you only knew what fortune lies in those crates, what power!
5.950000: Fortune built upon suffering is no fortune at all. It is theft and murder.
1.020000: ..
8.120000: Kimball, trembling but alive, spoke again in its guttural dialect, the chieftain's dying words reverberating through the warehouse with haunting authority.
2.180000: The final phrase rang out like a verdict.
3.950000: There, Watson, the bird delivers its testimony.
4.230000: Holmes, thank you. I thought this darkness would follow me to the grave.
4.620000: Justice may travel slowly, Captain, but it arrives eventually.
5.510000: Holmes stood, straightened his coat, and glanced down at Ashcombe with a final, measured gaze.
6.310000: Watson, alert, Inspector Lestrade, and ensure the Foreign Office receives a detailed account.
7.760000: count. This warehouse is a trove of evidence, enough to unravel the entire ivory conspiracy.
1.340000: ..
7.080000: At one's homes. And have someone collect this courageous bird. Kimbo has honoured the memory
4.560000: of its master with remarkable fidelity. Zee stepped into the light of the now
5.240000: bustling wharf. I felt the palpable weight of the morning settle into my bones. Fatigue,
5.380000: relief and the unmistakable awe that always followed, one of Holmes' triumphs.
3.770000: The case was far from concluded in the courts, but the truth had been unveiled,
3.420000: and Kimbu, perched proudly now, seemed almost triumphant.
5.290000: The fog had returned by the time Holmes and I left Blackfriars Wharf with Ashcombe safely in
6.460000: Lestrade. Hmm, ease custody. Hmm, yet I felt as though a different fog, that of disbelief and
4.060000: and lingering dread still clung stubbornly wide to the morning's events.
3.000000: Holmes seemed invigorated rather than exhausted,
2.180000: and his sharp stride along the embankment
4.010000: betrayed a mind still racing through layers of deduction and consequence.
2.130000: Imbo, now returned to a cupboard carrier,
3.160000: made occasional soft chirps that contrasted sharply
2.790000: with the anguished cries it had uttered in the warehouse.
4.350000: It seemed calmer, as though the shadow looming over its memory had been lifted.
6.440000: Watson, I trust your ribs are intact despite Ashcombe's less than gentle greeting?
1.180000: ..
4.010000: Tender, but functional. I've suffered worse in service at my one.
6.050000: Good. You'll need to be in full command of your faculties for the remainder of this matter.
1.840000: ..
6.190000: Holmes, pray tell. What remains? Ashcombe is arrested. His smuggling operations will be dismantled.
2.390000: The bird has fulfilled its remarkable purpose.
8.440000: us. Hone stalked beneath a lamplight, a faint glow casting precise angles onto his hawk-like profile.
9.060000: Come now, Watson, surely you do not believe that a man as calculating as Ashcombe operates without
9.560000: contingencies? You suspect accomplices? Suspect? No, I am certain. The question is not whether
5.820000: whether they exist but how deeply entwined they are with the Foreign Office and how eager
2.540000: they are to silence the final witness.
1.030000: The witness?
0.910000: You mean Kimboo?
1.280000: ..
0.680000: Precisely.
6.740000: A parrot may not be able to provide a legal deposition in court, but its ability to mimic
5.810000: the chieftain's dying confession renders it dangerously inconvenient to the guilty.
2.730000: Holmes, are you suggesting they are still being watched?
9.700000: Watson, I am suggesting we have been watched since the moment Kimbu first uttered the tribal accusation in Baker Street.
1.060000: ..
3.280000: Shiva crawled along my spine despite the thick wool of my coat.
3.270000: Holmes resumed his brisk pace and I struggled to keep up.
4.460000: We shall return to Baker Street. There we will set the final trap.
2.690000: The journey back was fraught with unease.
4.130000: I found myself, checking each passing handsome cab, each shadow doorway,
4.120000: imagining hidden enemies lurking within the very heartbeat of London streets.
3.530000: It was only once we reached the familiar cobblestones of Baker Street
3.940000: that a semblance of safety returned, though Holmes seemed no more at ease than before.
1.100000: ..
3.550000: Upstairs, Watson, and keep your revolver within reach.
2.770000: Holmes, is an attack truly imminent?
5.620000: If my calculations are correct, the accomplice will arrive within the hour.
3.910000: scope, but fear not, we shall be prepared.
4.190000: Once inside our sitting room, Holmes instructed me to place the parrot's cage atop the table
3.780000: near the window. He then drew the curtains halfway, allowing only
3.830000: partial visibility of the room from outside. Watson,
4.130000: position yourself behind the lacquered screen. I shall assume
4.460000: an attitude of contemplation here by the fireplace.
2.480000: The intruder will aim for me first.
4.280000: Holmes, surely this is unnecessary. We could inform Lestrade.
0.460000: Tee-lo!
1.780000: ..
8.100000: Lestrade, my dear fellow, he's undoubtedly occupied cataloguing every illicit item within that warehouse.
4.200000: By the time he arrived, our adversary would have vanished,
4.640000: leaving behind nothing but a broken window and a missing bird.
1.440000: ..
0.560000: The Legdalli.
3.260000: With reluctance, I hid behind the screen, revolver drawn.
4.700000: on. Holmes sat in his armchair with casual poise, yet I could tell his senses were attuned to every
5.080000: whisper and movement in the air. For many tense minutes, nothing occurred. Kimu shifted restlessly
5.180000: in its cage, tapping the wooden purge. Outside, a carriage clattered by. Then another. The clock
4.630000: on the mantoo chimed the quarter hour. Patience, Watson. The web is set.
5.370000: Suddenly, a faint scratching noise emanated from the window latch. Hum stiffened ever so slightly.
1.180000: I dare not read.
1.020000: ..
1.450000: The window lifted silently.
5.530000: A gloved hand appeared, followed by the silhouette of a figure clad in dark clothing and a mask.
2.870000: The intruder moved with the position of a trained operative.
3.410000: Not a common thief, but someone accustomed to infiltration.
1.810000: The bird. Where's the bird?
3.200000: Good evening. I believe you are seeking Kimbu.
3.890000: Kohn spoke with such calm that the intruder momentarily froze.
2.990000: Then, with a swift lunge, the man produced a knife.
3.010000: Sherlock Holmes, you leave me no choice.
1.340000: ..
3.780000: Before he could reach Holmes, I emerged from hiding, revolver raised.
2.110000: Drop the weapon this instant.
2.420000: Another step and the bird dies.
3.220000: You overestimate your advantage, sir.
4.340000: You see, you have made three critical errors already.
1.830000: What are you talking about?
1.040000: ..
3.380000: First, you approached the window without checking the street.
4.110000: Which informed me you act under time constraints.
5.230000: Second, your boots carry residue of red dyed laterite clay.
4.460000: The same we found in Ashcombe's warehouse but mixed with London soot.
2.910000: Meaning you have visited that location today.
2.190000: And third...
5.070000: Tones' hand shot out, knocking the knife from the intruder's draught with surgical precision.
2.330000: The robe staggered backward, stunned.
6.910000: You failed to anticipate that Watson's sense of duty rarely allows him to miss an opportunity to S.
3.190000: Hmm. Ave my life. Hmm.
1.260000: ..
3.270000: I moved swiftly and pressed the revolver to the intruder's chest.
2.510000: Surrender now. You are outmatched.
1.120000: ..
2.330000: You fools have no idea who I serve.
3.590000: On the contrary, I know exactly who you serve.
9.130000: The emblem sewn into your cuff, partially torn yet still visible, is from a private regiment operated under Ashcombe's patronage.
5.190000: You are the lieutenant he appointed to oversee the smuggling shipments.
3.180000: Holmes, you should never have interfered.
5.620000: And you should never have underestimated the consequences of murdering an African chieftain.
2.460000: ...
4.720000: They drew a lunge suddenly, attempting to break past me, but Holmes intercepted him.
4.560000: With a swift blow to the temple, the masked man collapsed to the floor, unconscious.
5.940000: A most inelegant attempt. Watson, if you would be so kind as to restrain him.
2.420000: ...
5.480000: I bound the man's wrists while Holmes retrieved the fallen knife, examining it with clinical detail.
6.910000: A ceremonial dagger, a shanty in design but crudely modified for stealth.
4.650000: This confirms he sought not merely to silence the bird,
5.640000: but to steal an artifact that might incriminate the entire network.
1.400000: ..
2.180000: Holmes, is the danger finally past?
4.220000: Yes, Watson. The final accomplice has revealed himself.
7.170000: With Ashcombe in custody and his lieutenant apprehended, the conspiracy is broken.
4.200000: Kimball chirped, then repeated the chieftain's final words once more.
2.900000: But this time, the tone sounded almost peaceful.
3.290000: The burden of its memory seemed at last to lift.
4.750000: Watson, observe the creature carefully. You may learn something.
2.830000: Holmes, what lesson could I possibly glean from a parrot?
7.900000: it. The virtue of unwavering truth, even when reduced to mimicry, the bird never altered a
7.600000: single syllable of its testimony. Many humans could aspire to such honesty. You surprise me
7.000000: with your sentiment. Nonsense. I speak only of the facts. Arrington arrived, shoddy thereafter,
4.880000: breathless from the haste with which he had come, when he saw the bound intruder on our floor and
3.450000: and Kimbu unharmed, his shoulders sad with profound relief.
2.540000: Holmes, I cannot thank you enough.
1.750000: You have avenged the chieftain.
2.280000: His memory, it will not be lost.
1.060000: ..
3.640000: Ensure the proper authorities handle the aftermath
4.660000: and see that Kimbu is returned to those who cherished him.
4.220000: Of course, the tribe will want to honor him for his service.
1.080000: ..
3.540000: After the intruder was taken away and Harrington departed with solemn gratitude,
2.190000: Holmes finally allowed himself to relax.
1.570000: He settled into his armchair,
2.640000: steepling his fingers as he gazed into the fire.
3.290000: Holmes, must every case end with such peril?
4.370000: Peril, Watson, is merely the cost of confronting the truth.
4.880000: But I dare say this particular case possessed a curious charm.
1.100000: ..
2.590000: Charm? Holmes, we were nearly killed.
4.270000: Ah, yes, but consider the intellectual elegance.
4.550000: A parrot bearing the dying words of a murdered chieftain.
6.160000: A conspiracy unraveled through logic, observation and an avian witness.
5.970000: Few detectives can claim such unusual companions in the pursuit of justice.
1.120000: ..
2.860000: Holmes, only you would raise a case for its oddity.
3.710000: My dear Watson, oddity is often the hallmark of truth.
3.530000: The world disguises its crimes in conventional clothing.
5.280000: building, when something appears unique, that is when one should look most closely.
4.820000: I sat opposite him, watching the fire flicker against the familiar clutter of our sitting
5.280000: room, the chemical vials, the scattered monographs, the violin resting quietly atop its table.
4.850000: Peace had returned, yet the memory of the day's dangers hummed softly beneath my skin.
2.990000: Combs, what shall I record as the moral of this adventure?
6.800000: chirp. Record that even the smallest voice, even the echo of a voice, can topple an empire built
9.400000: upon dirt. See it. Kimbo let out a final chirp, turning its head as though acknowledging the
4.850000: great detective's words. And for a moment, as the warm dew of the hearth washed over us,
4.870000: I felt an uncommon tranquility. The case had begun with a cry of death from a distant land,
1.760000: and ended with justice restored,
1.580000: carried upon the wings of a creature
1.810000: whose loyalty transcended kingdoms.
1.620000: I opened my journal,
0.910000: inked my pen
1.710000: and began to write the final lines.
1.130000: Holmes washed me,
2.530000: a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
0.770000: Sir!
2.660000: Do describe me generously, Watson.
2.640000: The public must have its hero.
2.600000: Holmes, you require no embellishment.
2.440000: Your deeds speak plainly enough.
2.520000: Then let us rest, Watson.
0.800000: Tomorrow,
5.340000: Tomorrow London will present new mysteries, and I dare say we shall need all our wits.
9.380000: ..........
