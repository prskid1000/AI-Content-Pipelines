5.790000: It was a calm winter morning and the faint golden light of the sun filtered into our sitting room at Baker Street,
4.510000: illuminating the quiet chaos of books, newspapers and Holmes' chemical apparatus.
2.560000: I had been attempting to follow an article in the Times,
5.690000: while Holmes, with his customary detachment, perused a slim monograph on rare gemstones.
2.870000: Hmm, look Watson, hmm.
8.180000: Here lies an instructive example, an account of a jewel thief who failed because he ignored the simplest observation.
3.600000: You never cease to find lessons in these reports, Holmes,
5.950000: yet what intrigues me is how you manage to reduce matters of the most bewildering complexity to mere trifles.
1.950000: Elementary, my dear Watson.
6.380000: A man must train his eyes to see and his mind to connect what others discard.
1.740000: ..
2.240000: Complexity is but the mask of ignorance.
3.560000: And yet, I confess, I am still struggling with that art.
3.420000: Every time I attempt to emulate you, I fall into error.
4.620000: That is precisely why I persist in your education, Watson.
4.020000: Wysh is not contouring, it is discipline.
6.950000: Now observe, your boots carry faint traces of the reddish clay from yesterday's walk by the serpentine.
4.310000: You did not notice it yourself, yet it speaks clearly to me.
5.240000: By Jove, Holmes, I had not the slightest notion. You astound me every time.
4.440000: And so, when a true mystery presents itself,
3.020000: the practice of noticing will serve us well.
1.740000: ..
1.390000: Ah! Listen!
4.850000: That is Mrs. Hudson's tread. She brings us a visitor.
3.480000: A gentleman to see you, Mr. Holmes, says it's urgent.
6.260000: The visitor entered, a tall naval officer with weather-beaten features and a look of suppressed anxiety.
5.130000: His uniform was impeccable, yet his gloved hands trembled slightly as he removed his cap.
2.930000: Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, forgive the intrusion.
1.610000: I am Commander James M. Watson.
1.370000: I am the artillery of Her Majesty's Navy.
5.580000: I come on a matter of the gravest urgency concerning a jewel known as the Blue Water.
4.890000: Blue Water? I have heard whispers of that name. Pray enlighten us, Commander.
2.890000: The Blue Water is no ordinary jewel, gentlemen.
7.430000: It is a sapphire of extraordinary size and purity, long kept as a naval trust.
4.390000: Yesterday, from a locked compartment aboard my ship, it vanished.
2.120000: I am ruined if it is not recovered.
1.340000: ..
2.670000: Holmes and I were seated in a handsome cab with Commander Illery.
4.970000: See, the frost of that winter morning clung to the windows as we rattled toward the docks by the Thames.
3.290000: I confess, my imagination was fired by the prospect.
5.470000: A jewel of incalculable worth, a theft upon a naval vessel, and Holmes in his element.
1.120000: ..
5.130000: Gentlemen, this is the Dauntless, my ship, and the scene of this deplorable theft.
1.440000: Remarkable, Holmes!
5.850000: The sheer order of a naval deck, yet within such order, a crime of the first magnitude.
4.780000: Okay, and that, Watson, is the paradox which interests me.
8.810000: A theft amidst perfect vigilance suggests either extraordinary cunning or internal collusion.
6.350000: I fear as much. The Blue Water was kept in the Captain's cabin, in a steel box with double locks.
5.970000: Only I and the First Lieutenant had keys. Yet the box was found forced open this morning.
3.850000: But surely, Holmes, that suggests a most limited field of suspects.
5.430000: Commander Illery ushered us below deck, into the Captain's quarters, where the theft had occurred.
6.470000: The cabin was orderly, almost austere, yet its every detail invited scrutiny under Holmes' searching gaze.
5.880000: A crude instrument used, and in haste, this was no professional cracksman.
6.400000: Note the rough scoring here, Watson, and the fragment of metal still lodged in the keyhole.
3.440000: By heavens, Holmes, you perceive all this from a mere glance.
6.180000: A not a glance, Watson, an accumulation of small certainties.
6.460000: Observe the dust displaced on the carpet, scarcely disturbed elsewhere, but heavily pressed here.
2.730000: Someone note to ply his tool.
4.120000: Then the thief must have acted in the night, when silence covered his efforts.
6.820000: Just so. Yet why here, and why now? That is what we must uncover.
3.440000: Commander, who had access to this cabin?
5.570000: Only myself, the first lieutenant, and occasionally the ship's steward when bringing supplies.
2.420000: No one else would dare.
5.160000: Commander Illery, pained with strain, wasted no time in summoning the two men under suspicion,
4.340000: Lieutenant Graves, his second-in-command, and the ship's steward, Mr. Finch.
4.840000: Holmes suggested that the mess hall would provide sufficient space and privacy for the examination.
6.600000: With measured dread, we made our way along the polished corridors of the vessel until we emerged into that long chamber
2.040000: where officers took their meals.
6.650000: Mr. Holmes, this is Lieutenant Graves, and here, Steward Finch, gentlemen, you will answer Mr. Mr.
2.080000: Holmes, directly and fully.
4.450000: Please be seated. I am less concerned with rank than with truths.
1.640000: ..
5.280000: Narrating, I noted the contrast. The lieutenant, with an officer's stiff bearing and narrowed eyes,
5.480000: and the steward, pale, twitching, visibly ill at ease, hums, with his piercing gaze,
3.880000: seemed to weigh both men as one might examine specimens in a cabinet.
7.540000: Lieutenant Graves, let us begin. At what hour did you last see the jewels secure in the captain's safe?
6.440000: Shortly after the evening round, sir. I verified the locks myself at half-past nine. The safe was undisturbed. Ah!
2.180000: ...
2.850000: Steward Finch, when were you last in the cabin?
5.170000: I? I brought wine for the captain's table at supper, sir. That was all. I never touched the safe.
1.790000: The man seemed shaken.
3.440000: Though whether from guilt or fear of authority, I could not tell.
8.800000: Tell me, Finch, why do your boots bear traces of reddish clay, when we stand upon damp cobble and salt-stained planks?
3.790000: I went ashore yesterday, sir. Only briefly.
11.740000: Briefly? And yet the clay clings thickly. Not the trace of a fleeting step, but the imprint of a prolonged errand. Where precisely did you go?
2.300000: To, to fetch tobacco, sir.
0.990000: Near Coving Garden.
6.850000: And you, Lieutenant? Did you observe Finch absent from the ship yesterday?
2.860000: No, sir. To my knowledge, he never left.
3.200000: That's false. I went ashore. I swear it.
1.180000: ..
11.880000: Enough. The contradiction itself is valuable. Watson, note how truth resists alignment. The clay upon Finch's boots, the denial of Graves.
3.320000: One of them conceals more than he admits.
12.720000: The interrogation aboard the Dauntless left my mind in turmoil. Finch's trembling denials, the Lieutenant's stiff refusals, and Holmes's quiet absorption all seemed to form pieces of a puzzle whose outline I could barely perceive.
10.280000: When, late in the afternoon, Holmes suddenly declared that we must return ashore at once, I pressed him for an explanation. But he offered only that enigmatic smile which told me nothing and promised everything.
3.130000: Habs, may I not at least know where we hasten?
14.720000: Patience, Watson. The clay upon Finch's boots was not of Coving Garden, nor of the Thames docks. It was from a garden soil unique to this quarter, red with iron. A careless slip betrayed him.
2.940000: Then you believe Finch lied about his errand?
2.680000: We entered the dim stairwell of the Nodging House.
1.010000: You really we?
5.500000: The air smelled of boiled cabbage and damp plaster, while the groan of old boards echoed beneath our seats.
0.000000: 
6.700000: We walked down the steps. Holmes, with noiseless tread, led us upward until we reached a door faintly marked with the Steward's name.
8.940000: Ha! ha! Here lies the heart of our matter. Observe, Watson, the wooden box locked yet light in the hand.
2.770000: Could it contain the blue water itself?
8.660000: Not so heavy, nor merely papers, perhaps correspondence. Yet even scraps of ink may speak louder than gems.
2.920000: Here, letters in a foreign language.
0.890000: The hand of the Lord.
7.740000: Italian. And see, this seal of a pawnbroker in Clerkenwell. The Steward was entangled in debt.
3.850000: Debt! Then perhaps he stole the gem to settle his obligations.
13.250000: Too crude for that. The forced lock. The clumsy entry. These do not speak of a desperate debtor. They speak of a decoy. The true hand is more disciplined.
2.120000: Then you believe Finch is but a pawn?
5.400000: That very evening, Holmes led us to Clerkenwell, where gas lamps glowed feebly upon shuttered shops.
8.510000: At the corner stood the pawnbroker's establishment, mentioned in Finch's papers. Holmes, with quiet instructions, stationed us in shadow while he himself vanished inside.
12.210000: Narrating, the minutes dragged. I felt my pulse quicken with every passing sound, until at last the shop-door creaked and a tall figure in naval greatcoat slipped within. Holmes's snare was closing.
2.500000: Graves, by heaven, it is he!
9.410000: In all the adventures I shared with my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, few rivaled the tension of that fog-drenched night in Clerkenwell when Lieutenant Graves slipped into the pawnbroker's shop.
5.660000: Bearing that fateful parcel, I felt the very air quiver with the weight of justice about to descend.
9.420000: Watson, observe! The parcel's bulk, its manner of unfolding. Yes, there! The blue water gleams at last!
2.140000: By heavens, it is the sapphire!
2.970000: Now, Commander, your moment!
3.640000: I will confront your lieutenant and reclaim your honour!
4.460000: Graves, you vile traitor! You dared betray the trust of the navy!
3.730000: Ay, I only meant to hold it as collateral. The debts, my honour, was lost already.
14.190000: Hours later, safe within the familiar warmth of Baker Street, I pressed Holmes for a full account. The fire crackled in the grade, and the sapphire itself lay upon the table, casting a faint blue radiance, as if mocking the fog and shadows of the night's adventure.
3.850000: Holmes, you must explain how you unravelled the tangle so swiftly.
22.240000: It was all, my dear Watson, a matter of exclusion. The lock upon the safe was forced with crude haste, clearly to suggest a common thief. Yet Graves possessed both the knowledge and the opportunity. He contrived to leave false traces, and seized upon Finch's debts to deflect suspicion.
2.530000: The red clay was the pivot.
9.390000: Finch, indeed, bore it upon his boots. But it was not from Govent Garden, as he claimed. It belonged to the very street where he lodged.
8.530000: Why, he lodged! The act, coupled with Graves's denial of Finch's absence, revealed collusion of silence and deceit.
2.540000: Then Finch was guilty of weakness, not of theft?
1.080000: ..
6.540000: Precisely. Graves preyed upon Finch's desperation, using his room and debts as camouflage.
8.490000: Yet the lieutenant's own arrogance led him to the pawnbroker, where his hands betrayed him with the sapphire itself.
3.930000: And so the Bluewater is safe again, thanks to your science of deduction.
0.480000: .
