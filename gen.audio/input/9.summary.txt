Duchess Violet arrives at Baker Street requesting help for Lady Beatrice Ravenscar; the Duchess presents a slipper charm and letter threatening scandal with midnight rendezvous. Holmes examines evidence, identifies villainy in theatrical tinsels: powder tin from cheap milliner, glue common French make rare sold London except to costumiers; confetti flour trampled swept by thief. Holmes seeks Mr. Lionel Vale of the company, who Prince Charming has fluttered foolish hearts in higher boxes; asks whether stranger bought glass slippers out hours not lobby shop but from dressing-room; Vale answers: a fellow with cavalry moustache came to his dressing room seeking old prop slipper saying he craved it as keepsake for lady dreaming stage. Holmes' eyes brighten, examines crystal charm against unseen pattern. Note chalkmarks upon third riser from water: triangles paired tip to tip east-west; circlet intersected by dash declares deposit. Holmes knelt on scuffed boards, examines tiny scratches found grain of tin glinting dully; draws slender ribbon black cloth clung odd snag with small clasp bright recent purchase and hard crumb soap for message mirrored glass read intended eye.

Colonel slides left; prince glides right; Miss Hart prepare pen. Holmes' hand quick as stoat took casket pressed hidden latch out slid hollow slipper crystal cunningly cut conceal narrow cavity within heel wrapped waxed paper with foolscap dotted numbers and names spelling ruin for men accustomed silence; colonel turned cane leveled like small lance: Holmes nodded to me pursuit close distance colonel's cane thrust glance from shoulder. I seized it, grappled, Holmes appeared behind him light step of cat tread glass.
