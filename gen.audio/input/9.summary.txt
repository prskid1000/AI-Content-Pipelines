Captain Reginald Harrington arrives at Baker Street seeking Sherlock Holmes' assistance. He brings Kimbu, an African Grey-Breasted Parrot, which he claims has been followed and threatened since his return to London from the Gold Coast. Harrington states that someone is trying to retrieve the bird and silence it. Holmes deduces a connection between the parrot's mimicry of a dying chieftain's final words and an ongoing conspiracy. Upon Captain Harrington's arrival, Holmes begins his investigation. He questions Harrington on the parrot's behavior and its supposed knowledge of a crime. The bird repeats a guttural phrase in an unfamiliar language. Holmes deduces that the chieftain died while Kimbu was present, suggesting the parrot recorded the final words. Holmes learns this is no random attack but a targeted pursuit by those who fear what the bird knows. Holmes deduces that a man named 'White-Hand' is responsible for the chieftain's murder. He leads Captain Harrington, Kimbu, and himself to Blackfriars Wharf. They locate a warehouse with ivory trade symbols matching those found on Ashcombe's boots. Inside, they confront Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Ashcombe. A violent struggle ensues, ending with Holmes capturing the colonel after he attempts to kill Watson. After capturing Ashcombe, Holmes suspects further accomplices. He deduces the colonel's lieutenant will try to retrieve Kimbu from Baker Street. Holmes and Watson set a trap at their sitting room. The accomplice, a masked man, attempts to seize Kimbu but fails after being observed for his boots' soil residue and his weapon's design. Holmes identifies him as the appointed lieutenant in Ashcombe’s smuggling operation. With both the mastermind, Lieutenant-Colonel Ashcombe, and his accomplice in custody, Holmes declares the case closed. The parrot, Kimbu, has delivered its testimony through its mimicry of the chieftain's dying accusation. Holmes instructs Watson to record their findings, emphasizing that even a simple bird can reveal profound truths when justice is at stake.
