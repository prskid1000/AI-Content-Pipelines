On a quiet winter morning in Baker Street, Watson reads his newspaper when Holmes notices subtle signs that Watson’s thoughts are already engaged with an impending mystery. Holmes deduces that Watson senses something abnormal approaching despite appearing calm and ordinary. The conversation reveals Holmes’s habit of detecting hidden details even in mundane moments, such as untouched tea and a blue stain on Watson’s cuff. Holmes points out a faint blue stain on Watson’s cuff, insisting it is not from pen ink but from contact with an extraordinary creature. He argues that ordinary headlines conceal deeper truths, and only by eliminating the impossible can they recognize the real mystery: a living being recently brought into their home. His keen observation shifts focus from routine to something biologically or chemically significant. Holmes instructs Watson to open the door after detecting signs of guilt or desperation in the knock. Upon opening it, they find a small wicker basket containing a duckling with unnaturally vibrant blue feathers that emits soft quacks. The creature’s unusual appearance and behavior suggest it is not a natural pet but likely part of an experiment, immediately drawing their attention as investigators. Examining the blue duckling, Holmes notes the uniformity of color and lack of skin irritation, concluding that the dye was professionally applied. He asserts such precision indicates deliberate preparation by someone knowledgeable in chemistry or crime. This moment confirms their suspicion: the duckling is not a prank but evidence left intentionally to attract their notice amid larger criminal activity. Holmes reveals that the blue dye originates from a laboratory near the Thames involved in testing counterfeit dyes with potentially dangerous applications. He explains that the duckling was abandoned deliberately as a message, part of a scheme far beyond mere eccentricity or mischief. The case now extends into industrial espionage and illicit chemical experimentation, demanding immediate action.
