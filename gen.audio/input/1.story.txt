[male_doctor_watson] It was a warm afternoon in Baker Street, and the hum of wheels upon the Marylebone Road came through our open window like a constant, patient drummer marking time for London’s immeasurable heart; Holmes lay at length upon the sofa, his keen eyes half-lidded, the violin at his side as though it were a sword sheathed after some brisk engagement, while I, ever the pupil, pored over a botany monograph he had placed in my hands to demonstrate how ash upon a man’s cuff could betray not only his trade but his parish and his habits of weathering, an exercise he insisted was “excellent for the muscles of attention.”

[male_detective_holmes] My dear Watson, if the monograph bores you, close it with a clear conscience; a muscle overstrained is as unfit for service as one untrained, and I would rather you kept your powers supple for something more diverting that is presently ascending our stair.

[male_doctor_watson] I started at that, for I had heard no bell and seen no shadow, and I ventured to ask him how he came by his certainty that a visitor was upon us, and what manner of visitor it might be to draw his interest from the idle torpor which sometimes claimed him between cases.

[male_detective_holmes] The aroma of otto of violet mingled with a faint whiff of coal-gas from a private carriage lamp, the delicate scrape of a narrow heel that has recently had its lift renewed, and a flutter of kid glove against broadcloth; the housemaid’s breath caught twice at the landing, which she does only when a personage of consequence appears: in sum, a lady of rank coming in haste with a matter she thinks romantic but which the law would call practical, and I, for one, am grateful to romance for the practice it affords.

[female_duchess_violet] Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, forgive this intrusion at such an hour, yet the hour presses me more rudely than my conscience; I am Violet, Duchess of Ravenscar, and I am sorely plagued by a masquerade that has leapt the footlights to tread the boards of life, a masquerade that calls itself “Prince Charming.”

[male_doctor_watson] The lady was tall, of commanding figure, yet with a countenance disordered by anxiety, and she held in her gloved hand a curious card of stiff white paste embossed with a slipper so delicate that even its printed heel seemed ready to snap; silver dust clung to the edges like frost.

[male_detective_holmes] Pray be seated, Your Grace; place the card upon the mantel where the light is kind, and tell me, in the brief, exact terms that are the only charity we can afford to truth, how this courtly prince has come to offend your house.

[female_duchess_violet] It began, sir, with letters that promised deliverance from dullness and a reign of happiness that seemed penned by a playwright; they were addressed not to me but to my niece, Lady Beatrice Ravenscar, who is of an age to dream and, I fear, to pay for dreaming; a masked figure calling himself “Prince Charming” contrived to meet her on the terrace of my London house after a charity ball and pressed upon her a crystal slipper pendant set with small diamonds; last evening the pendant vanished, a second note arrived, and this time there was in it a threat that if she did not meet him—as commanded—at midnight by the Cleopatra’s Needle, he would reveal matters that would destroy her reputation.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes turned the pasteboard under his long fingers, and the thin lips compressed slightly, like a violinist hearing a false note slip within a difficult phrase, and in that instant I realized that what had stirred him was not a question of petty romance but a scent of organized villainy dressed out in theatrical tinsels.

[male_detective_holmes] Your Grace, this silver dust upon the edge is not silver but powdered tin from a cheap theatrical milliner; the glue is of a common French make rarely sold in London except to costumiers; there is, moreover, a faint granularity that tells of flour—stage confetti that has been trampled and swept; I venture we have to do with a person who passes with ease between the greenroom and the drawing-room, and who knows that London ladies are most credulous when the footlights of imagination are upon them.

[female_duchess_violet] We had the misfortune to attend a pantomime at the Savoy last week where a certain actor, adored by the town, played a prince with a slipper that set the audience laughing and sighing; my niece has a taste for that sort of nonsense, yet I cannot believe the player himself would sink to extortion, and still my house is haunted by this foolish symbol.

[male_doctor_watson] I asked, perhaps with less tact than the situation warranted, whether Lady Beatrice had ever given cause for scandal, and the Duchess answered with the cold dignity of her class that the child’s only scandal was innocence carried to the verge of imprudence, a quality which, as a medical man, I have seen draw more trouble than malice ever could.

[male_detective_holmes] You have the second letter, Your Grace; let us hear its voice, for paper is a superb confessional when the writer is vain and the ink has not fully dried on his conceit.

[female_duchess_violet] Here, sir; you will observe it is scented and that certain words are underlined with a playful hand; it commands Beatrice to come alone, to wear white, and to carry with her a small casket of heirloom jewels as “pledge,” and it assures her that all will be merry as a Christmas pantomime if she comply.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes raised the letter to his nostrils, and then to the light, and at last held it flat while he measured the spacing with the blade of his knife as though it were a yardstick; he tapped the margin twice and then smiled without mirth.

[male_detective_holmes] Observe, Watson, the faint transliteration where another sheet has pressed upon it; this man keeps a ledger and writes his commands upon a pad, tearing off the page and leaving the ghost of his commerce upon the next; the underlining is not caprice but code for the placement of a rendezvous guard—these two underlines signal the Embankment stair, and the final flourish denotes the hour as the stroke, not five minutes past or before; such precision betrays a military sense mated to a theatrical taste, a union not uncommon in certain bankrupt officers out of India who have learned to drill illusions as once they drilled men.

[female_duchess_violet] Mr. Holmes, can you protect my niece without parading her name before the newspapers, for I would sooner risk my fortune than her good repute, and I know not where to turn but to your singular methods which all London praises and half believes.

[male_detective_holmes] You did perfectly to come; we shall not consult the newspapers, but we may consult the Savoy, and the Needle, and one or two alleyways that run between, and if we meet our prince we shall bow low and, I trust, pick his pocket of every pretense he carries.

[male_doctor_watson] The Duchess drew forth another object then, a slipper charm of crystal cleverly cut to catch the light, and on its toe a nick so minute that I would not have noticed it had it not been set at the very point like a dimple; she said it was the token first given and that Beatrice had kept it like a schoolgirl.

[male_detective_holmes] This nick is not a flaw but a maker’s sign scratched with a needle by one who believes in private hallmarks; we shall look for its twin and, finding it, shall find the hand that held the needle; Watson, your hat; Your Grace, send Lady Beatrice to her aunt’s house in Bayswater for the evening, and trust us to keep the midnight appointment you fear, though we shall not keep it exactly in the manner commanded.

[female_duchess_violet] I am in your debt, gentlemen; I shall remove Beatrice at once and hold myself ready to receive you, and I shall pray with all the fervour that society permits that your science of deduction is as gentle with her heart as it is stern with her adversaries.

[male_doctor_watson] The Duchess withdrew with a sweep of violet silk and a perfume that lingered like a chord struck and still vibrating, and Holmes, with that sudden accession of energy which I had come to associate with the scent of the chase, sprang up, took down his Inverness, and thrust into his pocket a small lens, a length of strong black cord, and a packet of those curious handcuffs of his own design which had before now shut upon wrists that thought themselves as nimble as eels.

[male_detective_holmes] The Savoy, Watson; if our prince has learned his manners upon the stage, the stage will betray him with a frankness the drawing-room never would; and if he has not, then our tour of the greenroom will still teach us what flour clings to a cheap crown and what paste to a counterfeit heart.

[male_doctor_watson] London that afternoon wore its familiar mask of indifference—the cabman’s slouch, the newsboy’s cry, the river’s brown patience—and yet to me it seemed as if every cornice were an eyebrow and every lamp a lid lowered over a conspirator’s wink, for I knew that in the metropolis the romance of the theatre and the precision of crime have often taken the same hansom to their rendezvous.

[male_detective_holmes] You observe, Watson, how the ash of this driver’s cigar flakes into wedgelets rather than mote; he smokes a cheap Havana and, if he were to turn his head, we should see a burn on his right lapel where he knocks away the ash with his forefinger, which, I might add, he would not do if he were left-handed; the city is an alphabet, and we advance only as we consent to learn our letters.

[male_doctor_watson] We alighted at the Savoy and were admitted backstage by an old watchman who recognized in Holmes the authority of one who is never refused twice; within, the world altered, for here were the raw and intimate limbs of illusion—ropes, flats, plaster crowns, and that compound odour of greasepaint, damp canvas, and stale bouquets that speaks of triumph and disappointment sleeping in the same trunk.

[male_detective_holmes] Good evening; we seek Mr. Lionel Vale of the company, the gentleman whose Prince Charming has lately fluttered a number of foolish hearts in higher boxes than you are accustomed to admire from the pit.

[male_actor_lionel_vale] Sir, I am he, though I blush to own that my flutterings are but the joint endeavour of author, tailor, and limelight; to what happy mischance do I owe a visit from Mr. Sherlock Holmes, whose praises are sung even in our paint-stained realm?

[male_detective_holmes] Mr. Vale, it is not your art I question but a parody of it; someone has taken your princely wares to market in the open streets; has any stranger asked to purchase one of your glass slippers, not in the lobby shop but out of hours, and in such a manner as would tickle a conscience even less fastidious than your own?

[male_actor_lionel_vale] By your leave, sir, some fortnight past a fellow with a cavalry moustache and a gait like a drill sergeant came to my dressing-room with a notion to buy an old prop slipper, saying he craved it as a keepsake for a lady who dreamed of the stage; I thought him an honest if theatrical admirer, but our property-master denied him, for the slippers belong to the house.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes’s eyes brightened at that description, and he fingered the crystal charm in his pocket as if measuring it against an unseen pattern; then he asked if there had been any thefts among the properties or a surplus of confetti unlike the house’s own.

[male_actor_lionel_vale] There was, sir, a sack of confetti gone astray three nights ago and a dresser dismissed for pilfering flour for some prank; also there came to us a lady journalist seeking notes for a column on the morals of the theatre, though she had more of the student than the scold about her, and she asked very particular questions about how one gains entry to a grand house under a mask.

[male_detective_holmes] Her name, if you please, and whether she wore upon her wrist a narrow black ribbon such as certain ladies of the pen affect because it holds a pencil nimbly when the hands are otherwise engaged.

[male_actor_lionel_vale] Miss Sybil Hart, sir, and she had indeed a black ribbon and a pair of eyes that would have made a moralist forgive the theatre and the theatre forgive the moralist in a single look; but she was harmless as a sparrow, I’ll take my oath upon it.

[male_doctor_watson] We thanked the player and turned to go, and as we passed the property room, Holmes knelt without ceremony upon the scuffed boards and with his lens examined a line of tiny scratches that the most domestic broom would never trouble to observe; he plucked from a crack a grain of something that glinted dully.

[male_detective_holmes] A shard from a cheap crystal mould and a powdering of tin; our prince has shod himself here; now, Watson, to the Embankment before the lamps are lit, for a staircase keeps better counsel by daylight and the river speaks more plainly in the afternoon than at midnight, when rogues suppose it asleep.

[male_doctor_watson] Thus began, under that deceptive warm afternoon, the Adventure of the Prince Charming, and I confess that I felt in my very pulse the strange mingling of innocence and calculation that runs through all such tales, for what is a fairy story but a criminal enterprise with better costumes, and what is a criminal enterprise but a fairy story that has mislaid its conscience and badly remembered its moral.

[male_doctor_watson] The Thames lounged beneath the Embankment like a sated python, its coils catching pewter gleams where a pallid sun worried the surface; we descended the stone stairs by Cleopatra’s Needle, and Holmes went on before me with the remorseless patience of a pointer taking scent after a rain; the wind bore upward the odour of tar, stale bread from a hawker’s cart, and the indefinable sourness of damp stone where many feet have hesitated.

[male_detective_holmes] Note, Watson, the chalk marks upon the third riser from the water: not the idle doodles of a child but a system—triangles paired tip to tip and, here, a circlet intersected by a dash; thieves’ cant, imported from the Continent, recently naturalized among certain London cracksmen who fancy themselves men of letters.

[male_doctor_watson] I peered, and though the scrawl seemed innocent as a schoolroom slate left unattended, the arrangement—two triangles pointing east and west, and the circlet like a stubborn sun held on a leash—cast a discomfort upon me as though I had deciphered a whisper not meant for my ear and found there my own name.

[male_detective_holmes] East-west denotes the play of watchers in pairs, while the circlet with a bar declares a deposit; our prince commands not only the lady but her casket; this stair, then, is both rendezvous and purse, a careless convenience that will serve until the police grow interested; I think we shall rob him of the experiment tonight and provide him a debut he did not rehearse.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes knelt and from the thin gap between the second and third stones drew a slender ribbon of black cloth that clung oddly, having caught on a snag; at one end was affixed a small clasp bright with recent purchase, and within the clasp a hard crumb of soap.

[male_detective_holmes] The ribbon of our lady journalist, or her cousin; the soap is a better witness—it holds in its heart the faintest print of a cipher traced by a damp finger and left to dry; observe how the tiny planes pale differently where pressure lay; the message would have been mirrored to the glass to be read by the intended eye; we must reconstruct the phrase, which, with your indulgence, I will do now upon my cuff.

[male_doctor_watson] With a pencil he made a set of small marks and then a series of lines joining them like stars mapped into a constellation; in no great time he had a sentence that, even to my unschooled gaze, possessed a certain sly elegance befitting a theatrically minded villain.

[male_detective_holmes] “White attire, midnight stroke; jewels for pledge; come alone lest the slipper shatter”; the author cannot resist his metaphor, but the instruction is plain; yet here is a flavor I do not like—“lest the slipper shatter”—it suggests a threat of a scandal made public in shards; blackmail, Watson, of the theatrical school, which is more dangerous by being half-merry.

[male_doctor_watson] He stood and looked upon the river and the great obelisk as if consulting antiquity for advice on modern scoundrels; then he touched my sleeve and drew me toward a bench where a man of compact figure with an imperial moustache sat polishing a walking stick whose silver fox’s head gleamed like a grin.

[male_detective_holmes] Good afternoon, Colonel—let us say Colonel, for the gait informs me more accurately than the stick—and allow me to recommend that a man who conducts business upon public steps should at least polish his stick where it cannot be recognized by a watchman who reads the illustrated weeklies.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] Sir, I do not know you, and do not thank you; the river is common property and my stick is my own affair; if you have business, bring it to me through my solicitor as honest men do.

[male_detective_holmes] My business is generally brought to me by rogues who cannot afford solicitors; your boots, with their square toes and the longer wear upon the outer heel, declare a military drill upon hard parade grounds; your stick’s fox was engraved in Bombay; the scar on your knuckle is of a sabre’s kiss; and your eye has that restless stageward glance of a man who watches exits and entrances; in short, Colonel Mordaunt, late of the 17th, now of the greenroom and the gambling room, the cards are upon the table.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] You will find, sir, that my cards are clean; as for my past, I display it freely because it is honourable, and if I like to see a play of an evening I do so as a patron and not as a player; now, if you will excuse me, I must attend to dinner.

[male_doctor_watson] He rose with a stiffness that betrayed a recent strain of the knee and walked off with more dignity than I would have credited to a man thus accosted, yet I saw that his hand tightened on the fox’s head until the silver whitened under pressure, a sign of anger that does not end at dinner.

[male_detective_holmes] The Colonel will figure again; a man does not carry Bombay in his pocket and the theatre in his eye without intending to spend both upon some operation; we must discover his company, for princes generally travel with a colonel to carry their baggage.

[male_doctor_watson] From the stair we went to Bayswater, where the Duchess had lodged her niece with a common practicality that sits well upon uncommon rank; Lady Beatrice received us with that mixture of embarrassment and relief which speaks of an indiscretion unconsummated, and at once she began to protest her innocence until Holmes stayed her with a courtesy so grave that it made her childish protestations seem superfluous.

[male_detective_holmes] Lady Beatrice, your reputation is not on trial here; facts are, and facts will do you the charity of keeping your name out of the mouths of those persons who nourish themselves on scandal; tell me, please, how the first meeting came about and why you consented to listen again when you had suspected harm.

[female_lady_beatrice] Sir, at the charity ball the music was so bright, and the air so full of laughing, that when a gentleman in a silver mask bowed and recited a line from the very play we had applauded, I thought it a jest sanctioned by the company; he spoke of rescuing me from dullness and said that London was a pumpkin that only the bold could roll into a carriage; I laughed, sir, as stupid girls do, and later in the garden he placed the little slipper in my hand and whispered that a prince must have a pledge if he is to claim a dance for life.

[male_doctor_watson] She said this with so touching an ingenuousness that I trembled at the thought of what wolves there are in the polite woods of our capital, and I could not but think of the many little tokens—charms, flowers, pins—that pass between the sexes as though they were nothing more than sparks shaken from a hearth, when in truth they may set houses ablaze.

[male_detective_holmes] And when the second letter came you did not intend to obey it, yet you feared what it threatened, and so you hesitated, which is precisely the interval upon which blackmail fattens; may I examine your jewel casket and the place where you kept the slipper?

[female_lady_beatrice] Certainly, Mr. Holmes; the slipper lay upon my dressing table by the looking-glass; the casket is here, and you will see that the lining bears a little scratch where the charm used to rest.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes bent over the glass as though it were a lake from which any number of drowned truths might be fished; he breathed upon it and, with the sleeve of his coat, conjured up faint smears that, to my surprise, resolved into letters not unlike those I had seen upon the soap crumb at the Embankment.

[male_detective_holmes] The same cipher traced with a damp finger and wiped in haste; and here, upon the casket’s velvet, a thread from a cuff of cheap lace; your maid, Lady Beatrice, is she a reader of penny romances and fond of the theatre?

[female_lady_beatrice] Alice is a good girl, sir, though she loves the gallery and will sometimes quote lines as she braids my hair; she has never done me harm that I know.

[male_detective_holmes] We shall make no enemies where servants are concerned unless they make us; still, I must see Alice to ask her whether she has lately acquired a ribbon for her wrist with a clasp of the sort your humble mirror has described.

[female_lady_beatrice] Alice is below, sir; you may command her attendance and, if she is foolish, you will find her quickly out, but I beg you not to frighten her more than is needed.

[male_doctor_watson] Alice, a slim, pretty creature with anxious eyes, entered at a curtsy, and Holmes addressed her with that austere kindness which makes the simple tell the truth as if they had always meant to do so and had only been waiting for permission.

[male_detective_holmes] Alice, the truth is the cheapest ribbon you can buy and the strongest; did you, in the last week, lend your wrist ribbon to a lady who writes for a newspaper and who has a curiosity about noble houses that exceeds the price of her column?

[female_maid_alice] Oh sir, I did lend it, but only because she said a lady can remember more with a pencil at her hand than with a poem in her head; she was kind to me and spoke as though she were my sister, and she asked me how one might get a footman to look the other way at a ball if the footman were honest but human.

[male_detective_holmes] And did she tell you her name, and did she give you anything in return besides the pleasure of friendly talk?

[female_maid_alice] Miss Sybil Hart, sir, and she gave me a little book of verses and a ticket for the Savoy gallery; I meant no harm, sir; I never do.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes inclined his head, satisfied, and when the girl had withdrawn he turned to us with that peculiar brightness in his gaze which signals the construction of a plan, as if the mind had just hung a new chandelier and was testing the switches with a finger of light.

[male_detective_holmes] The plot thickens with flour and lace, Watson; we have a colonel with a fox’s head cane, a journalist with a black ribbon, a stage prince with admirers and missing confetti, and a cipher that goes from river stair to looking-glass; tonight at midnight we shall keep the appointment—though not as commanded—and we shall see whether the slipper breaks or the spell does.

[male_doctor_watson] It was agreed that I should act as decoy, for I bore no resemblance to a lady in white, and it is exactly in that absence that a trap can be baited, if a man be cautious and a friend be near with a cord and a pair of cuffs; we returned to Baker Street to prepare, and there I watched Holmes arrange our little stage with the cool zest of a manager mounting a new piece.

[male_detective_holmes] You shall stand upon the stair where the triangles meet, Watson, with the casket—empty, but so ballasted as to persuade; I shall keep the shadow to your north, and we shall allow the watcher to reveal himself by the angle of his impatience; do not be heroic; be punctual.

[male_doctor_watson] Midnight found us in position; the river lapped and the stone breathed its damp; for long minutes nothing occurred but the swell of the tide and the far-off waltz of some late house where the party had long outstayed propriety; then there came a rustle as of silk denied a stage, and a figure in a pale cloak, slim and masked, stood at the top of the stair like a thought that has come too soon.

[female_journalist_sybil] Gentlemen, you are not a lady and you are not alone, and yet you have brought the casket like obedient boys playing rogues; I advise you to dismiss the shadow, Mr. Holmes, or else to employ me, for I am not the enemy you think.

[male_detective_holmes] Miss Sybil Hart, you could not hold your tongue even if the plot depended upon it; tell us quickly how you come to parley on the wrong side of the proscenium and why I should not summon Lestrade to grant your column a freshness it seldom enjoys.

[female_journalist_sybil] Because, sir, the prince you hunt threatens ladies who will never forgive the police but might forgive a pen, and because I have traced him to a ring of gentlemen who gamble away fortunes they do not own and recover them by charming pledges out of innocents; let me help you, and I will earn, for once, a headline that is honest.

[male_doctor_watson] Her voice carried an edge of fearless mockery and yet a gravity that made mockery seem a form of courage; Holmes, who prizes evidence but also admires style where it supports truth, lowered the hand that had gripped the cord and inclined his head a fraction.

[male_detective_holmes] Speak, then; and be advised that the river is stingy with second chances; name your prince and his throne.

[female_journalist_sybil] His nom de bal is “Prince Charming,” his true name—so far as any man with three club memberships has a true name—is Sir Alistair Mordaunt; his quartermaster is a soldier who left his honour in Bombay; his theatre is the Savoy when the lights are up and Holland House when they are down; tomorrow night there is a masked charity fête where he intends to collect three pledges in a single minuet, and if you are not there the season will wake to scandal harsh enough to make ballad sheets fat.

[male_doctor_watson] A shadow moved at the waterline—a second watcher—and before I could call out, Holmes’s whistle split the gloom and a shape leapt from a skiff, then another; there was a brief scuffle of feet and oaths like broken glass, and our unseen listeners fled along the bank with the catlike stride of men trained to vanish.

[male_detective_holmes] They are cautious enough to keep their names for the programme tomorrow; very well; Miss Hart, you have bought yourself a seat in the orchestra; Watson, polish your boots and your eyes; we, too, shall go to the ball, and I think our prince will find his slipper pinches when worn upon a foot that does not fit.

[male_doctor_watson] Holland House, on the appointed evening, glowed like a conjured palace, and its gardens held those whispering lamps which make sin and charity indistinguishable at a distance; Holmes, who affected a plain footman’s livery with such exactitude that I caught myself twice about to hand him my gloves, had arranged the passes for our entrance by means known only to himself and perhaps to one flustered clerk whom he had hypnotized with logic and tipped with half a sovereign.

[male_detective_holmes] Remember, Watson, that a mask is a confession printed upon satin; the honest man wears his own face uneasily and the scoundrel wears a false one as if it had grown upon him; keep to the edges, observe the hands—always the hands—and when the couplet is recited about pumpkins turning to coaches, note who glances toward the terrace, for he is rehearsing the exit.

[female_journalist_sybil] I shall take the gallery reserved for the press and ladies of uncertain profession; do not scowl, Doctor, it is a life’s work to inhabit uncertainty with a straight back; signal me by the handkerchief if your prince appears; I have notebooks within my bodice and daring where other women carry smelling salts.

[male_doctor_watson] The band struck up, and the great room turned like a slow, complicated machine wound by women's shoulders and men's ambitions; I felt acutely my plainness and was grateful for it, for it allowed me to watch without being watched; then I saw him—a gentleman in a silver mask, princely by posture rather than garment, who moved through the throng with the measured self-possession of one who has learned, in some harder academy, to command hunger and fatigue.

[male_detective_holmes] Sir Alistair Mordaunt beneath a whimsy of tinfoil; the jaw declares him though the mask would deny it; mark the colonel two paces in arrear, his fox’s head peeking from the cane like a confidant at confession; they will separate near the conservatory; the casket transfer will be under the cover of a quote no doubt worn threadbare from the Savoy; to positions, my dear fellow, and take care not to admire the roses, for their thorns are deputized tonight.

[male_doctor_watson] From where I stood I saw Lady Beatrice—by grace of the Duchess’s reconsidered mood—admitted discreetly in my company and kept near the matronly cluster where scandal starves; yet her eye wandered, poor child, with that fatal mixture of curiosity and shame which makes lambs step closer to the wolf to be sure it is a wolf; Holmes had arranged that she carry an imitation casket, while the true heirlooms were under lock, and that our culprits be allowed to attempt what they had rehearsed, in order that we might secure not only a single villain but a circle.

[male_detective_holmes] Now there—hear the line whispered—“to make a pumpkin of the city and a coach of the night”—and there, the gloved hand lifting as a cue; the colonel slides left; the prince glides right; Miss Hart, prepare your pen, for what follows is a chapter the town will read with its breakfast.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] A rose for your pledge, my lady, and a pledge for your rose; hold the casket so, and think of it as a tune you might hum, pretty and without consequence, even as the air grows crowded.

[male_detective_holmes] Not so fast, Colonel; the orchestra’s tempo is mine tonight; your fox has run to earth and the hounds are unsportingly close.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] You, sir, again; will you spoil a charity to play constable, or will you be content to drink and let gentlemen amuse themselves as gentlemen do?

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes’s hand, quick as a stoat, had the casket already; he pressed some hidden latch, and out slid not jewels but a hollow slipper of crystal cunningly cut to conceal a narrow cavity within its heel; within that, wrapped in waxed paper, lay a slip of foolscap dotted over with numbers and names that, even to my untrained intelligence, spelled ruin for men accustomed to silence.

[male_detective_holmes] A ledger by fairy tale, Sir Alistair; you have improved upon Cinderella by fitting the slipper to every foot you chose to threaten, and you have recorded the debts and indiscretions with a bookkeeper’s love of the precise; I congratulate you upon your invention and arrest you for its inevitable result.

[male_prince_mordaunt] Arrest, Mr. Holmes, is a word with a vulgar clang when pronounced amid violins; you have a knack for unmasking, but do you not think that the ladies you protect will weep when the newsboys bawl their secrets for a penny and a laugh?

[male_detective_holmes] I think, Sir Alistair, that the ladies will sleep after a brief weeping, and that you, meanwhile, shall discover how iron fits where crystal failed; I have sent for Lestrade, who, though he lacks my taste in music, has a baton the law is proud to acknowledge.

[female_journalist_sybil] Gentlemen, if you please, a word in the ear—Lestrade will be faster if the carriage gate is kept clear; I have bribed the porter with my reputation, which he found surprisingly negotiable, and the police may come in like invited guests if we do not tarry upon the doorstep arguing about the etiquette of arrest.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] You’ll not take my master with a woman’s help and a doctor’s bag; the fox has more holes than you have traps, and we know them in our sleep.

[male_doctor_watson] The colonel made for the terrace—swift, silent—and Holmes nodded to me; I pursued, my old service revolver weighing my pocket not as a promise of violence but as a guarantee of steadiness, for nothing steadies a man like knowing no necessity will surprise him; in the conservatory the lanterns sent pale islands of light onto the gravel, and the colonel turned, cane leveled like a small lance.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] I do not wish to hurt you, Doctor, for you have the air of a decent man; stand aside and let my affair pass by, and I will lay my mouth upon silence as upon a Bible.

[male_doctor_watson] You have already kissed away your oath; I advise surrender, for the house is surrounded by decency wearing boots, and even the flowers here would testify if called.

[male_detective_holmes] Never argue with a cavalryman when he has space to charge; clip the space, Watson; close, close, and turn his lance into a walking stick.

[male_doctor_watson] I obeyed with a rush, closing the distance; the colonel’s cane thrust and glanced from my shoulder; I seized it, we grappled, and Holmes appeared behind him with the light step of a cat that has learned to tread among glass; in an instant the colonel’s arms were pinned by the black cord from Holmes’s pocket, his cane burst in two, and from the hollow inside fell a coil of fine wire and a tiny bottle of chloroform such as a theatre doctor might carry for fainting ingénues.

[male_detective_holmes] A practical fellow, our colonel; his honour, like his cane, is hollow and hides tools for removing obstacles; Watson, secure his wrists; Miss Hart, do not faint, for he has more than enough smelling salts for us all, and none of it safe.

[female_journalist_sybil] I am better at printing crimes than at fainting away from them; I shall go to the gate and bring in your Lestrade like a chorus when the stage needs it; do not allow Sir Alistair to improvise, for his ad-libs run to cruelty.

[male_prince_mordaunt] Cruelty, madam, is a word ladies use to name justice when it turns and sees them; I will answer for nothing I have not signed, and if Mr. Holmes has brought handwriting experts to a ball, I shall almost admire him between indictments.

[male_detective_holmes] I have brought something more decisive than experts: your own vanity; this ledger bears your private marks, the same which dented the toe of a gift slipper with a needle so that you might know your handiwork in a crowd; your needle speaks across crystal the way a signature does across vellum; I fear you have been too original by half.

[male_doctor_watson] A stir at the doorway announced Inspector Lestrade, neat, vigilant, and wearing upon his countenance that mixture of skepticism and expectation which belongs to a man summoned by Holmes—skepticism that the matter will respect the forms, expectation that it will nevertheless be concluded solidly.

[male_inspector_lestrade] Evening, Mr. Holmes; I see your theatre has found its villain with admirable punctuality; Sir Alistair Mordaunt, you will be so good as to accompany me quietly; Colonel, I am sorry to find you a prop in this show; London will hiss where it once applauded.

[male_colonel_mordaunt] Spare your sermon for a cheaper gallery; we shall see if your handcuffs fit better than your moralities.

[male_detective_holmes] They generally do, Colonel; your fox may run no more; I have marked all your holes, and they are now attended by watchmen who collect no bribes and applaud no dramatics.

[male_doctor_watson] Sir Alistair kept his poise even as the steel embraced him; he looked at the room with the practiced contempt of a man who has bought applause and knows its price; and yet, as he passed Miss Hart, I saw a flicker cross his eyes like the memory of some single kindness that had not been part of any plan.

[female_journalist_sybil] Take him, Inspector; Mr. Holmes has done the art and you must do the craft; and when London reads of it I shall print as little of the ladies as the truth permits, for I am not in the business of breaking slippers in the street.

[male_detective_holmes] Then, Miss Hart, you are in the business of mending them, which is a rarer trade; come, Watson, we must see the Duchess and return to her the liberty of her niece and the education of her household; after that, perhaps, I shall permit myself an air upon the violin in D, which is the key of restorative conclusions.

[male_doctor_watson] The Duchess of Ravenscar received us in her library with a composure that only magnified the tremor of her hand upon the bellpull; Lady Beatrice hovered near like a penitent angel, while servants came and went like discreet punctuation; the house seemed to exhale relief in the way lamps do when their wicks are trimmed.

[female_duchess_violet] Mr. Holmes, I have had news enough to make an old woman of me and grace enough to keep me standing; is it done, and can the child sleep without dreaming of masks and staircases?

[male_detective_holmes] It is done insofar as the principal actors have been bowed off; Sir Alistair Mordaunt and Colonel Mordaunt—no relations except in enterprise—are at Scotland Yard; the ledger which threatened your peace will be safe from commerce; there remains only the reform of certain habits which invite rogues as cheese invites mice.

[female_lady_beatrice] Oh, sir, I am ashamed to the bone, and yet I confess I should not have learned caution had I not been endangered; if gratitude can melt shame, then I am free; if not, I shall bear it quietly.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes placed upon the table the counterfeit casket and beside it the crystal charm, now mated to its twin which he had found among the colonel’s effects; the two together made a tiny parody of a pair of children’s shoes, and I could not but reflect upon the childishness of grown persons when romance offers to escort them to ruin in a carriage drawn by adjectives.

[male_detective_holmes] The charm bears a needle mark, Your Grace, which ties it indelibly to the ledger; the same hand that thought to sign his trinkets signed his downfall; let it remind the household that nothing is so dangerous as an original scoundrel, for originality flatters our vanity and so loosens the strings of our purse.

[female_duchess_violet] You have my thanks and, if you will not be insulted by the word, my affection; and yet there is one debt I would pay more immediately: a debt to this young woman who has been accused in my hearing of a carelessness she never practised.

[female_maid_alice] Your Grace, I am sorry; I meant no harm; I lent my ribbon to a lady who spoke kindly and I dreamed of the gallery; I shall speak less and dream harder if you forgive me.

[male_detective_holmes] Forgive her, Your Grace; she has learned truth faster than she would have learned fear, and that is the proper education of a servant as of a prince; Miss Hart’s curiosity was of the useful sort; if Alice had denied her ribbon we should still be searching the wrong pockets.

[female_duchess_violet] Then I forgive, and will say no more; yet, Mr. Holmes, I must ask—what led you to the colonel first when there were any number of dandies who might have worn a silver mask and quoted a silly line?

[male_detective_holmes] His gait, Your Grace, a military exactness softened by indulgence; the fox’s head cane engraved in Bombay, thrown away as decoration by those who have never been; the clean-shaven cheek where an Indian climate makes shaving a purgatory for the unpracticed; and, most tellingly, a watcher’s eyes that measured exits as a quartermaster measures crates—he was the only guest at the river who looked for a staircase before he looked for a star.

[male_doctor_watson] The Duchess nodded, as people nod when they recognize wisdom they cannot administer yet would gladly employ, and she excused herself to speak with Beatrice in private; Holmes and I took our leave, and in the cab he turned to me with that look which promises a lesson if only I keep my vanity out of the way and my ears open.

[male_detective_holmes] Watson, what did you observe about Miss Hart’s entrance at the Embankment that I did not mention but nevertheless relied upon when I elected to trust her?

[male_doctor_watson] She spoke as if she had foreknowledge of our positions, and yet she did not signal to the watchers who fled; perhaps her courage was too sincere for a conspirator’s habits; also, her shoes were wet at the toe as if she had crossed from a skiff, and yet she came from the top; that suggested she had done more than approach; she had already reconnoitred the stair and found it spoiled.

[male_detective_holmes] Excellent, my dear fellow; the wet toes spoke more loudly than her eloquence; and there was the ribbon clasp with soap we found earlier—they seldom sell those to men who blackmail ladies; all pointed to a woman of inquiry rather than of intrigue.

[male_doctor_watson] We returned to Baker Street where the kettle sang and the violin waited; he took it up and played softly, a series of notes that rose like childhood recollections and then fell, at peace; he paused and smiled in that rare human way that makes him, for an instant, less a machine of logic and more the man who cherishes his friend.

[male_detective_holmes] I do not despise these little dramas, Watson; they are the steam that drives the engine of human motive; but I confess I prefer the clean click of a fact seated properly in its notch to the sighs of a duchess; the morning will bring newspapers, and we must prevent them from making a pantomime of our police.

[female_journalist_sybil] Speaking of newspapers, gentlemen, may a reporter trespass upon domestic felicity to return a ribbon to a conscientious maid and a debt of thanks to two men who keep London’s masks from eating its faces?

[male_doctor_watson] She stood at our door with the boldness peculiar to honest women who have chosen an immodest profession; Holmes bade her enter with the courtesy he never denies to merit; she laid the ribbon upon our table as a soldier lays down a medal, lightly and with pride.

[female_journalist_sybil] I have written my piece; it names no lady, it praises no villain, and it credits the police with all the craft and Mr. Holmes with all the art; if you object to the balance, I will rebalance to your taste, but I would rather keep my integrity than my post.

[male_detective_holmes] Keep both; the truth is often more saleable than the lie, when one can afford it; tell me, Miss Hart, why you took such risk as to dance on the very edge of the colonel’s watchfulness without the comfort of a warrant to hold you if you slipped.

[female_journalist_sybil] Because I am tired of reading tragedies in which the innocent are scolded and the clever are admired for their cleverness; I wished, once, to admire sense and scold wickedness; and if I may say so without impropriety, because I saw in Lady Beatrice a girl whose foolishness resembled mine at seventeen, and I thought I could pay back a debt to a world that had been unreasonably patient with me.

[male_doctor_watson] Holmes listened gravely and then, in a gesture rare for him, bowed as if to an equal on a field where the rules were unwritten; I felt in that moment a stirring of my own admiration that had less to do with the drama of the case and more to do with the quiet heroism that occasionally flowers in the soil of London’s ordinary streets.

[male_detective_holmes] If you keep to that creed you will be unpopular in certain circles and immortal in a few; do not permit editors to subtract your courage with their blue pencils; and, Watson, do remember that a deduction is only a kindness when it saves someone pain more than it causes embarrassment.

[male_doctor_watson] He turned again to his violin, and for a while the room held nothing but music and the faint crackle of the coal; outside, the city sighed and went on being itself—surly, magnificent, credulous, cunning—until a rap at the downstairs door reminded us that reputation is a vigilant creditor and often demands payment when the piece is barely over.

[male_inspector_lestrade] Mr. Holmes, Doctor—tidings; Sir Alistair has attempted magnanimity, offering to name names if we will permit him discretion; he underestimates the appetite of justice for such banquets; I thought you would like to know that our man intends to turn fairy godmother in his cell and conjure a pumpkin carriage for himself.

[male_detective_holmes] Decline his invitation, Lestrade; he will give you all without bargaining when he sees that his glitter has ceased to dazzle; assure him that the one mercy the law extends to men like him is the mercy of procedure, which is indifferent to charm.

[male_inspector_lestrade] As succinct as a warrant, Mr. Holmes; I shall leave you to your music and your morals; good night, Doctor, and nurse your shoulder; a cavalry cane leaves a bruise that enjoys its own company.

[male_doctor_watson] Lestrade departed, Miss Hart at his side to secure the dull particulars that make lively copy; Holmes set down the bow and turned once more to me with that half-smile which is his reward to my endurance and perhaps my only fee.

[male_detective_holmes] You executed your part well, Watson; you closed with the colonel precisely at the syllable when rhetoric would have been fatal; I could not have done better myself, though I might have done it earlier, which would have spoiled our evidence; and now, if you insist upon learning, you shall tell me what the two underlines in the note signified besides the stair position.

[male_doctor_watson] They signified, I believe, the presence of two watchers rather than one, and the necessity to occupy both with some rival spectacle, which Miss Hart provided simply by existing where she ought not to have been.

[male_detective_holmes] Admirable, my dear fellow; you grow; soon I shall be unemployed or, worse, celebrated beyond usefulness; to bed now, and in the morning you may write your chronicle, which I shall not read and yet somehow always respect.

[male_doctor_watson] The days which followed had that curious quiet which overruns London after a public scandal has been neatly avoided; there is a silence made, I think, by the absence of gossip that might have been; the Duchess sent a carriage of orchids with a note as restrained as an epitaph, and Lady Beatrice wrote to Miss Hart asking for a copy of the article in which no one was named and everyone was saved.

[male_detective_holmes] Observe, Watson, how the world is content to forget the very tragedies it thirsted to hear, provided it may applaud its own discretion afterward; the public is a narrator who leaves out the inconvenient chapters and credits itself with the moral; we, fortunately, are bound to a stricter memory.

[male_doctor_watson] Sir Alistair, as Lestrade later informed us, confessed with a prolixity that would have done credit to a novelist paid by the line; the colonel remained staunch and sour, but his pockets gave up a great many small instruments which, connected together, made a school of deception so well-equipped that I marvelled we had caught it with so little injury.

[male_inspector_lestrade] Your man sang, Mr. Holmes, in the bass of a gentleman and the treble of a coward; he gave us names, accounts, and a list of future fêtes he meant to harvest; for once I shall go to a ball to cancel it, and I will dance with every hostess to prove the police can turn better than a rogue.

[male_detective_holmes] Dance with care, Lestrade; the law’s toes are tender; and remember to send the Duchess her jewels after they have been stared at the proper length by the proper authorities, for property loves admiration almost as much as its owners do.

[female_journalist_sybil] I thought you might like to see the published piece, gentlemen; I kept the headline solemn and the ending neat; I exercised to the full the right of the press not to ruin girls to demonstrate the vigor of its type.

[male_doctor_watson] She laid the paper upon our table with a modesty which showed her pride more becomingly than any pressed claim; Holmes scanned the column, smiling at the points where the facts were plain and at the places where art had softened fact without bending it; the city would read it over tea and feel moral without being wounded, a rare conjunction.

[male_detective_holmes] You have told more truth by not telling all of it than many men manage in their confessions; take care—success is dangerous to the conscientious because it tempts them to attempt two honest things at once; do not try, for instance, to be just and witty upon the same line too often; the one will trip the other.

[female_journalist_sybil] I shall try, Mr. Holmes, to be merely kind and precise; as for wit, I have found it pleases most when it is suspected and not proved; and if your doctor friend will forgive a forwardness, I should be honoured if one day he would teach me how to read a bruise as he reads a pulse, for I suspect the city keeps its history upon human skin as much as in ledgers.

[male_doctor_watson] I answered that if she truly wished to learn the dull art by which the living advertise their recent past, I would gladly instruct her; and perhaps my eagerness betrayed something of the admiration which, if a man be honest, he must at times feel for those who use their courage in public where he uses his privately.

[male_detective_holmes] Watson will teach you the anatomy of consequences, Miss Hart; and I, since you have proved your discretion, will teach you the alphabet of traces, for the city is a text that rewards the literate; between you both you may publish a grammar of prudence for those who have none.

[female_duchess_violet] Gentlemen, forgive a duchess who returns like a common petitioner; I have come to deliver a letter that was meant for you but which found me first, and I confess I opened it, for I am too old for scruples when those I love are mentioned.

[male_doctor_watson] The letter, folded and refolded until the creases declared impatience, bore no seal; Holmes slit it with his knife and read silently, the line between his brows deepening not with alarm but with interest, as a mathematician’s might when a problem turns delightful.

[male_detective_holmes] From Sir Alistair; he begs—no, he proposes—a final act of magnanimity: that we allow him to return certain private letters, not yours, Duchess, but those of a lady he will not name, in exchange for our recommendation of leniency; he writes as a man who has mistaken my character for that of a manager who loves a neat curtain.

[female_duchess_violet] Will you—can you—Mr. Holmes, persuade the law to be gentle where a woman’s heart is concerned, provided that the man gives back what he stole and injures no one by his confession?

[male_detective_holmes] I cannot persuade the law to be what it is not, Your Grace; but I can promise that the law, when told the truth, does not relish injuring bystanders; I shall speak to Lestrade; the letters will be returned, not as a bargain but as an inevitability, and the sentence will be what sentences generally are—too heavy for the guilty in their own opinion and too light for them in the opinion of the injured.

[male_inspector_lestrade] Your word weighed, Mr. Holmes; the letters are recovered; the judge will hear that the accused facilitated their return; as for leniency, I have learned to leave that to benches and to Providence, and I sleep better when I do not advise either.

[male_doctor_watson] Thus concluded the principal matter; the city digested it as it digests all, with a brief fever and a long calm; yet for us, as often happens when the curtain drops, the real lesson began after the applause, and it was I who received it with a humility not entirely common to my nature.

[male_detective_holmes] You remember, Watson, the tiny scratch upon the charm’s toe; you saw it, you noted it, but you did not at first ask yourself why any man would mark what he planned to scatter among many hands; the answer is vanity, which, I have observed, is the telegraph wire upon which detection travels quickest; whenever a criminal stamps his authorship upon a thing without necessity, he offers us the courtesy of an autograph and a forwarding address.

[male_doctor_watson] I said that I should endeavour henceforth to look for unnecessary flourishes as if they were signposts rather than decorations, and that I would prefix to each observation the question “why this, and why thus,” which is in truth the catechism of all honest inquiry, whether in medicine or crime.

[male_detective_holmes] You will make a detective of me yet, Watson, by insisting I explain myself; when I am gone the city will still be legible, and if you have learned the alphabet you will not be lonely; moreover, you will write, and the writing of honest chronicles is itself a form of rescue.

[male_doctor_watson] That evening, as if to bless our resolution, Mrs. Hudson produced a pudding as virtuous as a sermon and as comforting as a mother’s hand; Holmes ate little but praised it much, which is his way, and afterward he took up the violin and played not in D, as he had promised, but in G, a key with something of the hearth in it, and I, hearing it, fancied that even the city nodded, content that for one night its fairy tales had learned their morals.

[female_journalist_sybil] Before I leave you to your music, gentlemen, permit me a last impertinence; I have heard said in newsrooms that for Mr. Holmes “everything is elementary,” and it is a phrase they use to belittle that which they do not understand; I believe it is the opposite: that everything is intricate, and that Mr. Holmes has the gift of untying the knots, which is not the same as pretending they were never tied.

[male_detective_holmes] You flatter me in a new and therefore interesting way, Miss Hart; the truth is that complexity is the only luxury we permit ourselves when lives are at stake, and simplicity is the only courtesy we offer when we return those lives to themselves; to make the complex elementary is a kind of surgery.

[male_doctor_watson] And so I write this as surgeon and student, as friend and witness; the case of the Prince Charming left behind it not broken slippers but mended propensities, which is better; and if, in later years, I should mislay the exact contour of the colonel’s scar or the particular glint of the slipper’s glass, I shall not mislay the sound of Holmes’s bow drawing from the strings that patient, clarifying note with which he returns the city to its senses.

[male_detective_holmes] Come, Watson; the night is honest again; let us walk a little, for the air has that early autumn crispness which pleases logic, and there is always the chance that a new visitor, perfumed with the promise of complication, is already ascending our stair.
