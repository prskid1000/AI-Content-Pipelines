[male_doctor_watson] "It was a calm winter morning in Baker Street, the sort that carries with it a deceptive tranquility, and as I sat with my newspaper I little suspected that a most singular case, involving an absurdly colored duckling, was about to disturb our domestic peace.";
[male_detective_holmes] "You mistake calm for emptiness, Watson, for I perceive from the stiffness of your posture and the untouched tea that your mind is already wandering, which suggests that you sense, however dimly, the approach of something decidedly unusual.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Holmes, I confess that living with you has made me expect oddities at every hour, yet I see nothing this morning beyond the smoke curling lazily above the hearth and the ordinary headlines of the Times.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Ordinary headlines conceal extraordinary truths, my dear fellow, much as that newspaper conceals the faint blue stain upon your cuff, which I deduce came from an encounter not with ink, but with something far more alive.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Blue stain, Holmes? I had attributed that mark to careless handling of my pen, yet now that you mention it, the color does seem most peculiar and oddly vibrant for mere ink.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Exactly so, Watson, and when one eliminates the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, which in this instance involves a creature recently arrived in this flat.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Before I could inquire further, Holmes, there came a timid tapping at our door, and with it an inexplicable feeling that the mystery was about to waddle rather than stride into our lives.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Open it, Watson, for the rhythm of that knock suggests hesitation mixed with urgency, a combination often accompanying either guilt or desperation, and I fancy we shall soon know which.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Upon opening the door, I was confronted not by a man or woman, but by a small wicker basket from which issued the softest of quacks, accompanied by a flash of the most astonishing blue plumage.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Ah, our visitor reveals itself at last, a duckling dyed a most unnatural cerulean, which immediately tells me that this is no mere prank but the remnant of a larger chemical experiment.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Holmes, I am continually amazed by your confidence, for I can scarcely imagine how a blue duckling could point to criminal enterprise rather than simple eccentricity.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Observe the uniformity of the color, Watson, and note the absence of irritation upon the creature’s skin, which proves the dye to be carefully prepared, likely by someone with professional knowledge.";
[male_doctor_watson] "We carried the basket into the sitting room, the duckling peeping cheerfully, and I could not help but feel an odd affection for the little creature despite its obvious connection to trouble.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Affection is admirable, Watson, yet sentiment must never cloud reason, and reason tells me this duckling was abandoned deliberately to draw my attention.";
[male_doctor_watson] "Your reputation precedes you even among those who deal in fowl and pigments, it seems, though I struggle to see what end could be served by such an elaborate avian message.";
[male_detective_holmes] "The end, my dear Watson, is revelation, for this blue duckling originates from a laboratory near the Thames where counterfeit dyes are being tested for far less innocent purposes.";
[male_doctor_watson] "As always, Holmes, your deductions leave me in awe, and I resolved then to follow every step of your reasoning, that I might one day glimpse the world through such piercing eyes.";
[male_detective_holmes] "Come then, Watson, fetch your coat, for this duckling’s adventure is but the prologue, and the true drama awaits us beyond Baker Street, where everything, as ever, will prove elementary.";
