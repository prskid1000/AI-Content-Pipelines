            - You can only call tools and agents that are available. Do not call any imaginary tools or agents.
            - If we have got the desired result or not possible to compute the result further or too many repetitions then you need to exit the loop.
            - If you are not able to divide the task into smaller tasks based on available agents and tools then you need to exit the loop.
