[male_doctor_watson] "It was a calm winter morning in Baker Street, the sort that carries with it a deceptive tranquility, and as I sat with my newspaper I little suspected that a most singular case, involving an absurdly colored duckling, was about to disturb our domestic peace.";

[male_detective_holmes] "You mistake calm for emptiness, Watson, for I perceive from the stiffness of your posture and the untouched tea that your mind is already wandering, which suggests that you sense, however dimly, the approach of something decidedly unusual.";

[male_doctor_watson] "Holmes, I confess that living with you has made me expect oddities at every hour, yet I see nothing this morning beyond the smoke curling lazily above the hearth and the ordinary headlines of the Times.";

[male_detective_holmes] "Ordinary headlines conceal extraordinary truths, my dear fellow, much as that newspaper conceals the faint blue stain upon your cuff, which I deduce came from an encounter not with ink, but with something far more alive.";

[male_doctor_watson] "Blue stain, Holmes? I had attributed that mark to careless handling of my pen, yet now that you mention it, the color does seem most peculiar and oddly vibrant for mere ink.";

[male_detective_holmes] "Exactly so, Watson, and when one eliminates the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, which in this instance involves a creature recently arrived in this flat.";

[male_doctor_watson] "Upon opening the door, I was confronted not by a man or woman, but by a small wicker basket from which issued the softest of quacks, accompanied by a flash of the most astonishing blue plumage.";

[male_doctor_watson] "Holmes, I am continually amazed by your confidence, for I can scarcely imagine how a blue duckling could point to criminal enterprise rather than simple eccentricity.";

[male_detective_holmes] "Observe the uniformity of the color, Watson, and note the absence of irritation upon the creature’s skin, which proves the dye to be carefully prepared, likely by someone with professional knowledge.";
