{{loc_1}} A British Victorian Living Room, situated at 221B Baker Street. The room is comfortably cluttered, its atmosphere dense with smoke from Holmes’s pipe and the lingering aroma of strong black tea. Against the far wall stands a tall bookcase, filled with volumes on chemistry, law, and arcane monographs of every kind. A large Persian rug, slightly worn at the edges, spreads across the wooden floor, providing warmth against the chill of winter. Near the fire burns a coal grate, its iron frame blackened from years of use. Holmes’s violin rests upon a side table, beside a stack of case notes tied with string. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits in the center, facing the fire, where I am seated. The window, draped in thick curtains, allows pale shafts of morning sun to pierce through the London fog outside. A chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing faint odors of experiment. On a small table rests the morning newspaper, folded and creased. Every object in the room seems to bear the mark of Holmes’s restless intellect.

{{loc_2}} Casper Bridge, an old Victorian stone bridge arching across the grey waters of the Thames. Its structure is formidable, built of large blocks of soot-stained stone, with iron railings running along its length. Beneath it, the river swirls with sluggish menace, reflecting pale light through the morning mist. At either end of the bridge, gas lamps rise from ornate posts, their glass fogged and cracked from years of weather. The cobblestoned surface bears the marks of hooves and carriage wheels, damp with condensation. A ragged newspaper flaps against the base of the railing, caught in the wind. Seagulls wheel above, their cries echoing against the water. On the southern approach, a cluster of warehouses loom with shuttered windows, and beyond them, faint outlines of tenements where chimney smoke rises. A single constable stands idly at the eastern parapet, stamping his boots against the cold. The air smells of wet stone, coal smoke, and the faint tang of iron from the river below. It is a bleak and desolate place, yet holds an aura of foreboding mystery.

{{loc_3}} Clara Whitfield’s Lodgings. The building is a tall, narrow Victorian townhouse with peeling paint on its shutters and soot-darkened brickwork. A crooked iron sign above the doorway reads “Rooms to Let.” The entrance hall inside is dimly lit by a sputtering oil lamp, its glass shade stained by years of smoke. A stairway of worn oak rises steeply upward, the banister smooth from countless hands. Faded wallpaper with floral patterns curls at the corners, and the scent of boiled cabbage wafts faintly from below. At the far end of the corridor stands a wooden door, its surface scuffed, marked with scratches, and secured with a tarnished brass lock. On a nearby table rests a vase of wilted roses, their petals fallen upon a stack of unpaid bills. A grandfather clock ticks ponderously in the corner, though its chime is muffled by dust. Outside the narrow window at the landing, one glimpses the bleak rooftops of neighboring houses, black against the pale fog. The atmosphere is one of genteel poverty, touched with sorrow.

{{loc_4}} The Riverside Warehouses near Casper Bridge. The district is a grim labyrinth of storage buildings, their soot-stained bricks rising four stories high. Iron shutters cover most windows, some hanging askew on rusted hinges. Wooden crates and barrels litter the cobblestoned yards, some broken open to reveal straw and rotting fruit. Rats scurry between heaps of refuse, their eyes glinting in the lamplight. Gas lamps along the quay flicker weakly, their light struggling against the heavy fog that rolls off the Thames. The river itself laps darkly at the wharf’s edge, carrying debris—splintered wood, scraps of cloth—on its sluggish current. Narrow alleys twist between the warehouses, strewn with ropes, chains, and damp sacking. The air reeks of tar, coal smoke, and brine. At the farthest warehouse, a lantern burns behind shuttered glass, throwing faint yellow stripes across the mist. The silence is broken only by distant hooves, the groan of timber, and the creak of a moored barge. The entire quarter breathes menace, as though it watches intruders with unseen eyes.
