{{loc_1}} The 19th century British Victorian living room is a medium-sized space with mahogany furniture and gas lamps. The lighting comes from both the brilliant winter morning sunlight streaming through the windows and the warm lamplight from multiple oil lamps. The polished wood floor has a Persian rug in the center, with scattered newspapers adding to the atmosphere. Cream-coloured walls are papered with heavy damask patterns, accented with gold and dark wood trim. A large green velvet sofa is positioned against the wall to the right of the fireplace, while a medium-sized wooden table with newspapers sits in the center near the fireplace. The central feature is a brick fireplace with fire burning, surrounded by a cast iron mantel. On the left side of the fireplace, there's a mahogany bookshelf filled with leather-bound books. To the left of the fireplace, a small cabinet holds chemical apparatus with various bottles and test tubes. Deep burgundy velvet curtains are drawn against the winter night outside, draped on the windows across from the sofa. A brass stand supports the chemical apparatus on the small cabinet to the left of the fireplace. The room is filled with a faint aroma of tobacco and coal, most noticeable near the fireplace area. On the mantel above the fireplace, there's a small brass clock, along with letters and pipes strewn carelessly. A recovered Blue Water sapphire in a small leather case rests on the center table. Cobalt blue vase on the table next to sofa adds color to the space. Around the center table near the fireplace are carved wooden chairs with dark brown and gold trim. An oak side table with brass fittings is positioned near the sofa on the right of the room, holding a small brass candlestick. In the far left corner against the wall, there's a wooden desk with a small brass key and compass. The atmosphere is intimate and tense but also calm, with elements of mystery and deduction.

{{loc_2}} The scene is set in a medium-sized Victorian living room, elegantly maintained with polished dark mahogany hardwood floors that gleam under the soft, filtered winter sunlight streaming through large windows on the left side of the room. The walls are adorned with deep, warm brown and muted red painted wood paneling, creating an atmosphere of timeless elegance. At the center of the room stands a grand marble fireplace, its black surface reflecting the warmth of the fire within, which flickers with orange and red flames and curling black smoke, casting a gentle glow across the space. Above the fireplace, a golden brass mantel clock ticks softly, its presence adding to the room's sense of timelessness. To the left of the fireplace is a large, dark green velvet-upholstered settee, positioned facing the armchair on the right side of the fireplace, which is a deep red velvet-upholstered piece with a carved wooden frame. A medium-sized mahogany polished wood side table sits next to the armchair, holding an open book titled 'Holmes's monograph' and a glass of whiskey beside a whiskey bottle. In the center of the room, opposite the fireplace, stands a large mahogany polished wood table where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are engaged in conversation with a naval officer, who is near the door at the right side of the room, cap in hand. The newspaper lies neatly folded on the table next to the monograph, while the winter sunlight filters through the window, casting a warm glow over the scene. Outside, faint sounds of a carriage and distant dog barks echo from Baker Street, adding to the atmosphere of tension and anticipation that fills the room as Holmes's deductions unfold.

{{loc_3}} The scene is set in the large, historic London Docks during a cold winter morning, where golden sunlight filters through the fog. The central element is the HMS Dauntless, a dark blue ship with pale yellow accents, moored at a quay with a disciplined deck and gleaming brass railings. A wooden crate being hauled by dockhands is positioned next to the ship near a gangplank. Drays with barrels are pulled by horses nearby, while gas lamps cast long shadows on damp cobblestones. Seagulls circle above, and naval officers in navy uniforms stand at attention near the gangplank. The warehouse building, made of blackened brick, stands along the quay to the left of the ship. Smoke rises faintly from the galley chimney, and fog drifts over the Thames, adding an ethereal look. Damp wooden planks cover the quay, with cobblestoned areas showing tar residue. The atmosphere is tense and mysterious, with a sense of urgency due to the theft, as golden sunlight breaks through the fog, casting a warm glow on parts of the scene. Scaffolding leans against the warehouse, and ships' masts rise above the quay, contributing to the industrial setting. Dock hands in navy and gray uniforms work near the crate, while the overall mood is enhanced by the cold air and the historical ambiance of Victorian London.

{{loc_4}} The scene is set in the captain's cabin aboard the HMS Dauntless, a medium-sized room with a naval British Royal Navy style from the early 20th century. The lighting comes from brass hanging lamps and a porthole, casting a moderate brightness during the morning. The polished oak floor has scuff marks near the safe, with warm tones from the wood and light grey from salt air. The walls are made of oak paneling and feature a steel safe, colored in dark brown and mahogany wood tones. Objects include a large steel safe on the far wall with a slightly ajar door, a large desk at the center of the room facing the porthole, medium-sized brass lamps hanging from ceiling beams near the center of the room, a medium-sized porthole on the far wall above the safe, a medium-sized wooden chest in the corner near the safe leaning against the wall, a seaman's coat hung neatly on the back of the wooden chest, a stack of logbooks on top of the desk to the right side slightly out of place, navigational instruments on the desk next to the logbook stack, metal filings scattered on the floor near the safe indicating a broken lock, a salt air smell throughout the room, acrid tang of metal filings near the safe and on the floor around it, scuff marks on the carpet near the safe, a forced lock on the steel safe door slightly ajar, broken lock tool marks on the safe door near the keyhole, an oilcloth parcel with a faint sapphire glow not yet placed but will appear in the final confrontation, and a box marked with the steward's name not yet placed but will appear in the interrogation scene. The atmosphere is tense and mysterious during winter.

{{loc_5}} The Officers’ Mess aboard HMS Dauntless is a medium-sized room illuminated by oil lamps hanging from brass brackets and pale daylight filtering through narrow portholes, casting a moderate brightness in the morning. The dark wooden floorboards contrast with the deep brown wooden paneling on the walls. At the center of the room stands a large, polished dark oak table, its surface marked by a forced lock and rough scoring, as Holmes examines it closely. Around the table are neatly arranged high-backed wooden chairs, while a sideboard along one wall holds carefully stacked cutlery, pitchers, and plates in silver and ceramic. A large portrait of Her Majesty Queen Victoria hangs sternly on the far end of the room over a wall. Dust motes drift in the pale daylight through the portholes, illuminated by the light, as creaking floorboards add to the ambiance. The air carries faint scents of polish, pipe smoke, and yesterday’s stew, with distant groans from the ship’s timbers and muffled thrumming of water against the hull. Holmes, Watson, Commander Ellery, and Lieutenant Graves are present: Holmes at the table analyzing clues, Watson observing him closely, Commander Ellery providing context near the table, and Lieutenant Graves sitting tense at one end of the table as he answers questions. Steward Finch’s boots, marked with reddish clay from a garden soil in his district, stand on the floorboards where he had knelt to work his tool. The atmosphere is tense yet filled with subtle signs of life and usage.

{{loc_6}} A narrow Victorian-era street at the edge of Covent Garden is bathed in the soft glow of gas lamps and filtered late afternoon sunlight through a thick fog. The cobbled road, grayish-brown with dark soil from traffic and moisture, stretches underfoot, its surface slick from damp air. Soot-stained brick walls line the thoroughfare, their flaking green shutters and peeling woodwork adding to the aged charm of the lodging houses that crowd the street. Gas lamps flicker with a yellowish glow tinged by blue from burning gases, casting long shadows on the cobbled path. Vendors and costermongers occupy the central area, their wooden carts and baskets brimming with apples, onions, and other fruits arranged neatly on the cobbles. A roasted chestnuts vendor stands nearby, his cart emitting a golden steam that curls into the fog. The air is thick with the scent of roasting nuts and damp earth as a cat slinks between the feet of passersby. A violinist plays faintly near an awning, their dark clothing reflecting the gaslight’s glow on the violin’s body and bow. At the center of the scene, a lodging house stands half-hidden in fog, its dark brick façade marked by flaked green shutters and a brass number plate that glints faintly through the mist. A young man walks with a newspaper, his pale face visible under the gaslight, while a woman stands near a shop, her dark coat and red scarf catching the light. The atmosphere is tense yet familiar, as if something unusual is about to unfold amidst the bustling street life of late 19th-century London.

{{loc_7}} A small lodging house room with a modest interior showing signs of long-term use by a working-class individual. The lighting is provided by a single flickering candle on the desk during the night, casting dim and flickering light throughout the room. The ground consists of damp wooden floorboards that are dark and slightly faded. The walls have peeling paint in muted beige with faint brown stains from water damage. Objects include a narrow iron bed against the left wall near the middle of the room, a cracked washbasin on a wooden stand near the iron bed, a single chair pulled close to a rickety desk, and a rickety desk by the chair. A single candle is on the desk, casting dim and flickering light throughout the room. Scattered papers are on and around the desk, and a wooden box is on the desk to the side of the candle. Faint fog is visible through the cracked window, partially covered by threadbare curtains in light brown with frayed edges and holes. A coal scuttle near the hearth has cold ashes inside it, scattered on the floor near it. A spare coat hangs on a nail by the door, slightly askew. The atmosphere is intimate and tense during winter, with a damp wool smell permeating the entire room, most noticeable near the bed and coat, and stale tobacco permeating the entire room, more noticeable near the desk and candle. The damp wooden floorboards are visible under all objects, especially noticeable near the bed and scuttle, and the peeling paint on walls is covering all four walls, more visible near the window and hearth.

{{loc_8}} A narrow historical lane at night, illuminated by gas lamps with a yellow glow. The damp stone and cobblestone ground is gray and dark brown underfoot everywhere. Light brown weathered brick walls line the street and alleys. A pawnbroker’s shop with dark wood and faded paint stands on the corner of the narrow lane, its wooden shutters and stained glass windows casting a pale yellow glow from inside. Thick gray fog fills the air around the street, mingling with coal smoke in the winter night. Holmes and Watson stand in the shadows of a nearby alley, while Commander Ellery and Lieutenant Graves are positioned with them, the latter leaning across the pawnbroker’s counter with a parcel in hand. The pawnbroker, an older man, bows over his counter inside the shop. Gas lamps along the street and alleys cast light on parts of the street, and a watchman’s rattle hangs in the distance. Carriage wheels are somewhere far off, and dampness and decay cover walls and ground with dark green and brown mold. The atmosphere is tense, mysterious, foggy, and cold, with the mood of winter adding to the scene's eerie ambiance. The gas lamps’ moderate brightness adds to the overall dim lighting, while the damp stone and cobblestone ground underfoot everywhere contributes to the historical setting.
