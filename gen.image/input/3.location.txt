{{loc_1}} The scene is a medium-sized historical interior, specifically a Victorian living room. The lighting comes from a fireplace and lamplight, casting a moderate brightness during the evening. The ground consists of dark hardwood flooring in a mahogany color. The walls are covered with wood paneling in a walnut shade. In the center left of the room is a large fireplace made of brick, colored black and gold. Facing it, at the center of the room, is a large green sofa upholstered in emerald green leather. Next to the sofa is a medium-sized wooden table made of polished mahogany wood. Scattered on the floor near the table and sofa are small yellowed newspapers. On a cabinet near the fireplace, there are various glass bottles and copper pipes forming a chemical apparatus. The large velvet curtains in deep burgundy color are drawn across the windows to block out the winter night. Above the fireplace is a large mantel made of polished walnut wood. Strewn carelessly on the mantel are small brass pipes and yellowed paper, representing letters and pipes. On the center table next to the wooden table and sofa lies a recovered Blue Water sapphire in a deep blue color with a gleaming white core inside a leather case. The air fills the entire room, with a warm temperature felt throughout due to the fireplace and lamplight. Aromas waft through the room from the fireplace and lamps. Soft crackling of the fire and faint ticking of a clock on the wall create the sounds in the room. Shadows cast long shapes from the fireplace and lamplight. Other details, such as various decorations made of mixed materials, are scattered around the room in Victorian style decor. The atmosphere is cozy, mysterious, and intellectual during the winter season.

{{loc_2}} The Victorian living room is bathed in soft winter sunlight filtering through large bay windows to the left of the room, casting golden light that illuminates the gold braid on Commander James Ellery's naval uniform. The deep pile wool carpet in muted aubergine color covers the ground, with small faded moth holes along the edges. Dark oak paneling with gilded moldings lines the walls, displaying rich mahogany tones with gold leaf accents on the trim and picture frames. A large fireplace dominates the center left wall, its black soot-streaked brick surface framed by a cast iron surround with intricate floral patterns in bronze. Above it, a mantel clock with a mahogany wood body and brass inlay ticks softly, positioned slightly to the right of center on the mantel. A dark green velvet sofa, upholstered in horsehair, is placed against the right wall, angled toward the fireplace. Beside it, an armchair with carved mahogany and gilded acanthus leaf carvings faces the fireplace, where a fire glows brightly with golden orange and deep red embers. Between the sofa and armchair, a tea table made of ebony wood with brass inlay sits centered on the rug. Near the left side of the room, against the wall, stands a reading table of dark oak with brass inlay, polished mahogany with gilded edge banding. On its edge, Holmes's monograph on rare gemstones, bound in hand-tooled leather, leans to the left, while Watson's newspaper (The Times), folded with a red headline border, rests slightly to the right. Commander James Ellery stands near the door, cap in hand, his deep blue naval uniform adorned with gold braid and polished brass buttons. The faint sound of carriages and distant dog barks echoes in the background. Holmes, seated at the armchair in a dark suit with a white dress shirt and cravat, engages in discussion with Watson, who is seated on the sofa in a similar attire. Mrs. Hudson, in a brown dress with a white collar, discreetly withdraws from the scene.

{{loc_3}} The small Victorian-style shipyard dock is bathed in the dim golden light of a winter morning sunrise, filtered through a thick layer of light grey to white fog. The quay's cobblestone ground, a mosaic of grey and black stones with white grout, stretches beneath the scene. Blackened brick walls and wooden planks, weathered by algae and moss into dark grey, brown, and greenish tones, form the dock's surroundings. At the center of the quay stands the medium-sized ship 'Dauntless,' its white and black hull adorned with brass details, resting on a wooden planked gangplank with iron nails that connects it to the dock. In the background to the left, a large warehouse with dark grey walls and brown shutters looms, while in the foreground to the right, a horse-drawn dray with a black, brown, and white harness stands near the warehouse. Dockhands in dull brown and blue woolen clothing scatter around the quay, and naval officers in dark blue uniforms with gold accents gather near the gangplank. A signboard on the warehouse wall bears chalk lettering against its wooden surface. Above, ship masts of black wood and brass rise above the quay, while seagulls circle overhead with white bodies and black wings. The air is thick with fog, through which golden sunlight filters in hazy beams. Smoke from the ship's galley chimney rises faintly, mingling with the mist, as wooden barrels stacked on the dray and crates being hauled by dockhands add to the scene's industrious yet mysterious atmosphere.

{{loc_4}} The medium-sized Captain's Cabin on the HMS Dauntless exudes a military nautical style. Brass lamps hang from ceiling beams, casting a warm glow that complements the polished oak floor with brass inlays and walnut-brown oak paneling on the walls. A large steel safe stands against the far wall, slightly ajar with a forced lock, while a broad desk dominates the center of the room, facing the safe. The porthole on the upper right wall admits dim grey winter light through tempered glass. A wooden chest sits in the corner near the desk, and a seaman's coat hangs on a polished walnut peg. Logbooks, charts, and navigational instruments are scattered on the desk, with faint scuff marks on the wool carpet near the safe. The atmosphere is calm but tense, hinting at hidden clues amidst the scent of salt, polish, and metal filings in the air.

The cabin's lighting comes from both brass lamps and the porthole, creating a moderate brightness during morning hours. The polished oak floor with dark brown and gold tones contrasts with the walnut-brown gloss finish of the walls. The steel safe is grey metal with rust stains on its door handle, made of stainless steel and brass parts, positioned to draw attention as a secondary element. The broad desk, crafted from polished oak in walnut-brown, serves as the primary focal point. Brass lamps, with their gold color and warm glow, are secondary elements hanging from ceiling beams. The porthole's tempered glass admits dim grey light, contributing to the overall mood of calm tension. A wooden chest made of solid mahogany sits near the desk, while a seaman's coat in navy blue hangs on a polished walnut peg. Logbooks, yellowed parchment books bound in leather, are stacked on the desk next to faded blue and white charts on wooden frames and tarnished navigational instruments. Faint scuff marks on wool fabric near the safe add subtle texture. The air carries the scent of salt, polish, and an acrid tang of metal filings, enhancing the atmosphere of a tense yet calm environment.

{{loc_5}} The officers' mess aboard a 19th-century British naval ship is a medium-sized room with polished oak flooring featuring dark brown tones and golden highlights. Smooth wood paneling in walnut tones, aged to a warm patina, lines the walls. At the center of the room stands a large, highly polished long oak table in dark mahogany, surrounded by medium-sized high-backed wooden chairs with walnut-stained, worn edges along both sides. Brass fixtures with clear glass shades hang from brass brackets on the ceiling as oil lamps, providing moderate lighting alongside daylight filtering through portholes—dark wood with brass frames positioned near the ceiling on either side of the room. A medium-sized sideboard with mahogany and gilded trim runs along one wall, holding neatly arranged silver cutlery tarnished slightly, white porcelain pitchers with gilded edges to the left, and white china plates with blue trim to the right. A large portrait of Queen Victoria in a brown frame with gold leaf accents hangs centered over the far end wall. Dust motes float in pale daylight from the portholes, while the air carries the scent of polish and faint traces of pipe smoke drifting near the table and chairs. Brownish residue from yesterday’s stew lingers on the floorboards, which are dark brown with golden highlights, covering the entire space. The atmosphere is serious and formal, underscored by the groan of timbers and muffled thrums of water echoing through the room during winter.

{{loc_6}} A historical Victorian street scene unfolds under the soft glow of gas lamps and fading daylight. The cobbled stones, dark grey with moss patches, form a textured ground beneath the soot-stained brick and stone walls of lodging houses lining the street. Gas lamps cast a yellowish light from bronze fixtures with glass shades, evenly spaced along the thoroughfare, some being tended by lamplighters. Large hansom cabs, black with gold trim, rest along the street, while vendors in wooden carts and tables hawk chestnuts and flowers. Costermongers gather around fruit piles, their stalls bustling with activity. A thick fog, white and low-hanging, curls around buildings at the level of boots and carriage wheels, obscuring parts of the scene. A black cat with tabby markings darts across the street, while a violinist plays faintly in the background. Brass number plates on lodging houses gleam yellow and dark brown, half-hidden by fog. Moss patches sporadically dot the cobbled stones, and soot stains mark the bricks and shutters. Flaking paint on walls adds to the aged appearance of the buildings. Reddish soil, matching the dirt on Finch's boots, is found near lodging houses. The atmosphere is cosy yet mysterious, with a cold winter day casting a chill through the fog-laden air.

{{loc_7}} The small lodging house room is dimly lit by a single candle on the desk, casting long shadows across the dark brown wooden floor with worn spots. The pale yellowish gray plaster walls enclose the space, adding to the oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere. A large narrow iron bed, rusted black in color, stands against the north wall near the window, draped with a thin grayish beige wool blanket. On the south wall, a small dull brown wooden stand holds a cracked mottled gray ceramic washbasin. To the east wall, centered, is a large rickety desk of pale yellowish brown wood, with scattered papers in beige and yellowed paper on its surface and the floor nearby. A single white wax candle sits on the desk next to a medium-sized reddish brown wooden box. The cracked window, dark greenish gray glass, is covered by threadbare grayish blue fabric curtains. Near the hearth on the south wall lies an empty blackened steel coal scuttle filled with cold ashen gray ashes. A spare coat of dark navy blue with faded trim hangs from a nail by the door on the east wall near the desk. The air carries a damp wool smell and stale tobacco smoke, enhancing the winter fog outside's chill effect on the room's already bleak ambiance.

{{loc_8}} Clerkenwell street at night in the Victorian Industrial Era is a scene steeped in mystery. The foggy atmosphere, illuminated by dim gas lamps and pawnbroker's shop lights, casts long shadows across the grayish-brown cobblestones and wet brick walls. The surrounding buildings are made of weathered brick, ranging from dark gray to brownish-red due to soot accumulation. Gas lamps, with their yellowish light, are evenly spaced along the street, some slightly leaning from age, while a pawnbroker’s shop stands on the corner of a narrow lane, its dark red brick facade accented by pale yellow window lights and wooden shutters. A watchman patrolling near the entrance clutches a dull bronze rattle, his dark clothing blending with the night. In the shadows of an adjacent alleyway, Holmes, Watson, and Commander Ellery stand partially obscured by fog, their dark wool and leather garments mirroring the dimly lit surroundings. Inside the shop, the pawnbroker examines something at his counter while Lieutenant Graves leans over it, holding a parcel containing the Blue Water sapphire. The atmosphere is tense and mysterious, with coal smoke rising in thin plumes from distant rooftops and chimneys, and fog swirling around gas lamps and people. Barred windows on the shop's front, partially obscured by soot and fog, cast faint yellow glows, while wooden shutters slightly open allow some light to escape. The damp stone surfaces, dark gray to blackish, glisten with moisture, and brass buttons on Lieutenant Graves' naval uniform catch the dim light. Shadows from alleyways stretch long across the ground near Holmes and his party, adding to the sense of impending revelation.
