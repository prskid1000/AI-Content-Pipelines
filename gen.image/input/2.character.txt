Her dark hair is cut short at the sides but flows in thick waves down her back, often tied loosely with a frayed ribbon. Build: petite frame but strong-shouldered, early to mid-twenties, showing signs of resilience despite her fragile appearance; carries herself with a quiet defiance. Clothing: a simple woolen dress in muted green, slightly stained from travel, with a high neckline and full skirt, paired with a threadbare shawl wrapped tightly around her shoulders; worn leather gloves tucked into the sleeves, and sturdy boots with iron-tipped soles for walking through the mud. Details: a small carved wooden pendant hangs at her throat, posture: rigid but tense, as if bracing for impact, slender yet unyielding in spirit, with hands that are soft but show signs of calluses from years of manual labor or long walks.

((female_landlady_mrs_hudmore)): Face: sharp-featured and angular, pale skin with a faint red flush on her cheeks, dark eyes that seem to pierce through people, thin lips often drawn into a tight line; thick eyebrows that arch sharply above her gaze. Her hair is a deep black, styled in an austere bun at the back of her head with a few strands framing her face like a halo. Build: tall and commanding for her age, late 50s to early 60s, exuding an air of quiet menace; every move deliberate and precise.

Build: wiry frame with a hunched posture, middle-aged to elderly, exuding an aura of nervous energy despite his attempts to appear calm. Clothing: a threadbare coat made of moth-eaten fabric, paired with worn trousers and a frayed scarf wrapped around his neck; a battered satchel slung over one shoulder.
