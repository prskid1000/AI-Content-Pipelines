 Character Description = Clara Whitfield has an almond-shaped face with a pale, almost translucent complexion that reflects light like frosted glass. Her dark brown eyes are wide and luminous, framed by long lashes. Her nose is straight but slightly upturned at the tip, giving her face a delicate, almost ethereal quality. Her lips are thin and often slightly parted, hinting at a quiet anxiety. Her hair is medium-length light chestnut with subtle natural highlights that shimmer under candlelight. Her shoulders are slender, and her torso has an hourglass shape, but her posture is slightly hunched, as if burdened by unseen weight. Her arms are long and delicate, with fingers that are unusually long for a woman of her age. She wears low-heeled leather boots with worn soles, which leave faint marks on the floor. The clothing is a blend of wool and cotton in muted tones, designed to be modest yet elegant. Her attire is slightly disheveled at the edges, hinting at a recent struggle. A faint scar is visible on her inner elbow, which seems to be from an old injury. Her overall presence exudes a mix of youth and weariness, with pale skin showing signs of stress and exhaustion.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = Mrs. Hudmore has a round face with a mottled skin tone that ranges from pale pink on her cheeks to a darker olive on her neck. Her eyes are large and dark brown but filled with a tired, watchful look. Her nose is small and slightly hooked, giving her face an angular structure. Her lips are full and often pursed in disapproval or concern. Her hair is graying brown, tied back loosely with a simple silver chain that bears the family crest. Her shoulders are hunched slightly, and her torso is slender but forlorn with prominent ribs visible under thin fabric. She has very poor posture, slouching forward as if to avoid confrontation. Her hands are thin and bony with fingers that are unusually long, suggesting a lifetime of manual labor. Her legs are medium in length, with lean muscles that show signs of weariness. She wears a dark gray dress made of heavy wool, which hangs loose on her frame. Her footwear consists of worn leather slippers that have been mended multiple times. She has a constant furtiveness in her gaze, as if always looking for something or someone.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = Edward Mason has an oval face with pale skin that is almost luminescent under the dim light. His eyes are blue-gray, and they flicker with anxiety when he speaks. His nose is sharp but slightly aquiline, giving his face a noble appearance that is contradicted by his trembling hands. He has thin lips and a sparse light stubble on his jawline. His hair is dark brown with highlights of silver, tied back loosely to keep it from falling over his eyes. He stands tall with a lean frame, but there's an unnatural stiffness in his posture due to the tension he carries. His arms are medium in length, with the right palm showing deep calluses from walking through rough terrain. He has a slightly swollen left foot encased in mud-stained leather boots that have one missing button on the right glove. His clothing is tailored but worn, made of wool blends, and his accessories include a small gold pocket watch chain that is visible at his waist.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = Sherlock Holmes has an oval face with pale, almost ghostly skin that appears to be perpetually cool despite the heat of the room. His eyes are piercing blue-gray, sharp as a hawk's, and seem to see through layers of deception. His nose is narrow and slightly hooked, giving his face a hawk-like intensity. He has thin lips, always pursed in thought or concentration. His hair is dark chestnut brown with streaks of silver at the temples, styled in a disheveled manner as if he had just returned from an investigation. He has thick, dark beard that frames his face and contributes to his overall air of intensity. His shoulders are narrow and slightly sloped, but his arms are long and lean, ending in fingers that are oddly long for someone so tall. His posture is upright with a slight forward lean as if always searching the horizon for clues. He wears a tight Victorian gentleman's ensemble made of wool, tweed, and velvet, with a deerstalker hat left on the back of his chair and a magnifying glass attached to a silver chain around his neck that he constantly fiddles with.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = Dr. John Watson has an oval face with fair skin that is slightly rougher than Holmes', showing signs of past injuries. His eyes are dark brown, deep and watchful, always scanning for details. He has a straight nose and thin lips, which give him a reserved appearance. His hair is light brown with streaks of gray at the temples, tied back loosely to avoid obstructing his vision. He has thick, bushy eyebrows that contribute to an expression of constant observation. His facial features are defined by small scars from past operations, particularly on the right hand where he once performed a critical procedure. He stands medium in height with a slim build but has lean muscles and a slight hunch due to years spent reading newspapers rather than lifting weights. His arms are medium in length with long fingers, which are slightly calloused from previous work. His legs are medium in length with lean muscles that show no sign of fatigue. He wears a dark blue coat with a white collar, paired with black brogues, and carries a leather satchel with medical instruments.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = The scarred villain has an angular square face with pale skin that is rough and cracked like old parchment. His eyes are small slits of narrow, dark brown pupils set deep in his skull. He has a hooked nose bent slightly to the right at the bridge, giving him a sinister look. His lips are thin and often curl into a sneer. His hair is long and dark, tied in a loose braid that hangs down his back with occasional strands escaping from the braid. He has thick, dark eyebrows that frame his face like two shadows. His shoulders are broad and slightly hunched, revealing a muscular chest that bears a deep scar running from the left temple down to his jawline, another along his cheekbone. His arms are medium in length but thick with calloused hands, showing signs of past violence. He has long legs with toned muscles, ending in broad feet encased in thick-soled boots worn from years of hard labor. He wears coarse fabric clothing that is frayed and stained with mud.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = The shorter villain is a man with a round face, pale skin that is smooth but sallow in tone. His eyes are dark brown, sharp and intelligent with a flickering look that betrays his nervous disposition. He has a sharply tapered nose and thin lips that often quiver when he's anxious. His hair is jet black, slicked back in an unnatural way that shows the product used to keep it in place. He has thick eyebrows shaped in a natural arch, giving him a slightly hawkish look. He stands medium height but has a slender build with narrow shoulders and a lean torso. His arms are short in length, ending in delicate hands with a missing button on the right glove, which he often fidgets with when nervous. The right palm of his hand bears a small scar from an old injury that seems to be a constant source of discomfort for him. He wears tight clothing made of fine wool, dapper but slightly frayed, with footwear of brogues still damp with river mist and marked by clay from the banks near Casper Bridge.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table. The window, framed by richly embroidered curtains, reveals a frosty landscape beyond, where rooftops gleam like lace under the winter sun.}}, {Sunny Winter Morning};Place ((male_doctor_watson)), the Character in Image 1, {Neutral}, {Sitting on sofa}, {Reading newspaper};.

SCENE TEXT-DESCRIPTION:
 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table. The window, framed by richly embroidered curtains, reveals a frosty landscape beyond, where rooftops gleam like lace under the winter sun.}}, {Sunny Winter Morning};Place ((male_doctor_watson)), the Character in Image 1, {Slight Amusement}, {On sofa near fire}, {Turning page of newspaper};.
