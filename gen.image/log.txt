 Character Description = The scarred villain has an angular square face with pale skin that is rough and cracked like old parchment. His eyes are small slits of narrow, dark brown pupils set deep in his skull. He has a hooked nose bent slightly to the right at the bridge, giving him a sinister look. His lips are thin and often curl into a sneer. His hair is long and dark, tied in a loose braid that hangs down his back with occasional strands escaping from the braid. He has thick, dark eyebrows that frame his face like two shadows. His shoulders are broad and slightly hunched, revealing a muscular chest that bears a deep scar running from the left temple down to his jawline, another along his cheekbone. His arms are medium in length but thick with calloused hands, showing signs of past violence. He has long legs with toned muscles, ending in broad feet encased in thick-soled boots worn from years of hard labor. He wears coarse fabric clothing that is frayed and stained with mud.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Character Description = The shorter villain is a man with a round face, pale skin that is smooth but sallow in tone. His eyes are dark brown, sharp and intelligent with a flickering look that betrays his nervous disposition. He has a sharply tapered nose and thin lips that often quiver when he's anxious. His hair is jet black, slicked back in an unnatural way that shows the product used to keep it in place. He has thick eyebrows shaped in a natural arch, giving him a slightly hawkish look. He stands medium height but has a slender build with narrow shoulders and a lean torso. His arms are short in length, ending in delicate hands with a missing button on the right glove, which he often fidgets with when nervous. The right palm of his hand bears a small scar from an old injury that seems to be a constant source of discomfort for him. He wears tight clothing made of fine wool, dapper but slightly frayed, with footwear of brogues still damp with river mist and marked by clay from the banks near Casper Bridge.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

SCENE TEXT-DESCRIPTION:
 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table. The window, framed by richly embroidered curtains, reveals a frosty landscape beyond, where rooftops gleam like lace under the winter sun.}}, {Sunny Winter Morning};Place ((male_detective_holmes)), the Character in Image 1, {Surprise}, {Standing by window}, {Looking outside};.

 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table. The window, framed by richly embroidered curtains, reveals a frosty landscape beyond, where rooftops gleam like lace under the winter sun.}}, {Sunny Winter Morning};Place ((male_detective_holmes)), the Character in Image 1, {Surprise}, {Standing by window}, {Looking outside};.
