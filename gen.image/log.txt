 Character Name = female_clara_whitfield. 

 Character Description = Clara Whitfield has a heart-shaped face with an olive-toned complexion that glows softly under the dim light, her skin smooth but tinged with faint freckles across her nose and cheeks. Her eyes are almond-shaped, deep brown in color, framed by thick lashes that flutter nervously when she is anxious; they appear almost luminous, catching the light in a way that suggests hidden strength behind the gentleness of her gaze. Her nose is straight but slightly upturned at the tip, giving her a delicate yet determined look. She has full lips, naturally rosy and often parted in thought or fear, with a small scar on the left cheek from an old childhood accident that still lingers as a faint line across her skin. Her hair is long, dark auburn waves cascading down past her shoulders, slightly frayed at the ends from frequent handling; it is tied loosely behind her head with a blue ribbon that matches the trim of her dress. Her posture is hunched slightly, as if carrying an invisible burden, and though she appears slender, there‚Äôs a quiet strength in her stance. She wears a dark blue wool dress, modest but well-fitted to her figure, with white lace cuffs and collar; the fabric has softened over time from long hours of work. Her boots are worn on the left side, where she bears most of her weight, and her hands, small and pale, often tremble slightly when nervous. A silver locket hangs around her neck, containing a faded portrait of a young girl, and she always carries with her a simple handkerchief embroidered with initials C.W. Her presence is one of quiet resilience and inner fire that belies the calmness of her exterior.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Anime Style.

 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table.

 Illustrate an exact scenery like {{A British Victorian living room, nestled within the iconic 221B Baker Street, is bathed in the soft glow of a sunny winter morning. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of burning coal and the faint aroma of strong black tea, mingling subtly with the acrid tang of tobacco from Holmes‚Äôs ever-present pipe. The room is comfortably cluttered, filled with the signs of an active mind‚Äîstacks of case notes tied with string lie beside a Persian rug that stretches across the polished wooden floor, its edges slightly frayed but still vibrant in deep crimson and gold hues. A tall bookcase lines one wall, brimming with tomes on chemistry, law, and obscure monographs, their spines worn from years of use. Near the fireplace, a large iron coal grate radiates warmth, its blackened frame marked by soot and time. Holmes‚Äôs violin rests elegantly on a side table, where it is often left after an impromptu performance or deep contemplation. A heavy sofa with well-worn arms sits centered in the room, facing the fireplace, its fabric slightly faded but still sturdy and inviting. At one end of the room, thick drapes catch the pale winter light filtering through the window, casting long shadows across the floor as it pierces the lingering London fog outside. A small chemical apparatus on a stand near the mantelpiece bubbles faintly, releasing the faintest of odors from ongoing experiments. On a nearby table lies the morning newspaper, folded and creased at the edges, its pages slightly yellowed with age. The lighting is soft yet bright, emphasizing every detail in the room‚Äîdust motes catching the sun‚Äôs rays as they drift lazily through the air. Every object seems to carry the mark of an intellectual mind, from the careful arrangement of books and notes to the faint traces of ink on the side table. The window, framed by richly embroidered curtains, reveals a frosty landscape beyond, where rooftops gleam like lace under the winter sun.}}, {Sunny Winter Morning};Place ((male_detective_holmes)), the Character in Image 1, {Surprise}, {Standing by window}, {Looking outside};.
