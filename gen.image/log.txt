 Character Name = female_clara_whitfield. 

 Character Description = Clara Whitfield has an almond-shaped face with a pale, almost translucent complexion that reflects light like frosted glass. Her dark brown eyes are wide and luminous, framed by long lashes. Her nose is straight but slightly upturned at the tip, giving her face a delicate, almost ethereal quality. Her lips are thin and often slightly parted, hinting at a quiet anxiety. Her hair is medium-length light chestnut with subtle natural highlights that shimmer under candlelight. Her shoulders are slender, and her torso has an hourglass shape, but her posture is slightly hunched, as if burdened by unseen weight. Her arms are long and delicate, with fingers that are unusually long for a woman of her age. She wears low-heeled leather boots with worn soles, which leave faint marks on the floor. The clothing is a blend of wool and cotton in muted tones, designed to be modest yet elegant. Her attire is slightly disheveled at the edges, hinting at a recent struggle. A faint scar is visible on her inner elbow, which seems to be from an old injury. Her overall presence exudes a mix of youth and weariness, with pale skin showing signs of stress and exhaustion.. Strictly, Accurately, Precisely, always must Follow Realistic Digital 3D Animation Style.
