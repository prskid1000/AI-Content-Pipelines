🚫 Added negative prompt to prevent static facial expressions
Full prompt: In a sunlit Victorian sitting room on a bright winter morning, soft golden light streams through the large window, illuminating the warm wooden furniture. A man with blond hair sits on the left side of a plush red sofa, wearing a white dress shirt and dark tie, his body angled toward the fireplace as he reads a newspaper held in both hands. He has blue eyes that gaze intently at the pages, his expression deeply contemplative. As the camera slowly dollies forward, focusing on his concentrated face, sunlight casts long shadows across the ornate rug beneath him. The room is rich with texture—wood paneling, patterned carpet, a small potted plant on the round table beside him—and the gentle glow of a lamp on a side table enhances the cozy atmosphere. His posture remains still and upright as he continues reading, his gaze fixed on the newspaper in his hands.
