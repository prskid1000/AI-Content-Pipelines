A second man stands by the window, calmly examining footprints on the sill through a magnifying glass. The sound of the wind outside is faintly audible, and the occasional creak of the wooden floorboards accompanies his movements.

His expression is one of incredulous focus as he watches the detective closely. On the round wooden table before him are books, papers, and a small brass globe.

A tall man with sharp features, dressed in a dark coat and scarf, stands beside the large window, his breath visible in the frigid air. He leans forward, examining the window sill closely, his gloved hand tracing the edge as he searches for evidence. Standing just behind him, a shorter man with a kind face watches intently, his eyes scanning the details with focused attention. The faint sound of wind howling outside blends with the soft creaking of wooden floorboards beneath their feet.

Full prompt: Style: cinematic - realistic - The image transitions from a bright daytime interior to a foggy Victorian street. A man in a light-colored shirt sits at a wooden table near large windows overlooking green trees, then the scene shifts. Now on a cold evening, a mist shrouds cobblestone streets outside 221B Baker Street. Horse-drawn carriages line the road as street lamps glow softly through the fog. A man in a dark coat stands beside another, adjusting his collar while holding a lantern. Beside him, a nervous woman sits inside a carriage, clutching a satchel tightly. The sound of hooves on stone and distant chatter blends with the quiet rustle of wind against wet pavement.

Full prompt: Style: anime - cinematic - The young man with brown hair and blue eyes sits at a wooden table in a sunlit room, arranging small metal discs. He wears a dark sweater over a white collared shirt with a large bow tie. As he moves the disks, his expression shifts from focused to slightly smug. Outside the window, green trees sway gently under a bright sky. The soft clinking of metal pieces on wood and distant birdsong fill the quiet room.

Full prompt: Style: cinematic - The young man stands in a sunlit dining room, giving a thumbs-up with a warm smile. He is wearing a white button-down shirt with a red logo and tan pants. Outside the large window, green trees sway gently in a bright breeze under a clear blue sky. Sunlight streams across the wooden table where a teacup and small vase sit undisturbed. The atmosphere is calm and cheerful, contrasting sharply with the foggy, cold evening scene described in the prompt.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The man with orange hair sits in a horse-drawn cab, his blue eyes focused as he holds a velvet box on his lap. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice, "The evidence points to the carriage driver." The woman beside him clutches her satchel tightly, her face pale and uneasy. She looks toward Holmes with wide eyes. A soft lantern sways from the ceiling, casting flickering light across the fogged windows. Outside, cold evening mist drifts past the glass while faint horse hooves echo on wet pavement.

Full prompt: Style: cinematic - realistic - The woman stands in the dimly lit room, her head bowed as she looks down at the satchel in her hands. She speaks softly, her voice trembling with sorrow: "It was supposed to be a new beginning... but now it's just another end." Her fingers trace the worn leather of the bag as she speaks. The detective stands nearby, his eyes fixed on her with quiet intensity, holding an ornate ring between his fingertips, studying her every movement. Beside him, the doctor leans forward slightly, his expression filled with sympathy, listening intently to each word. Outside, cold evening fog drifts across the grounds of {{loc_6}}, muffling all sound except for the crackle of the fire in the hearth and the soft rustle of the woman’s breath as she speaks.

Full prompt: Style: cinematic - realistic - The young man stands in the snow outside a warmly lit house. He is holding an envelope in his right hand. As he looks down at it with concern, he opens the envelope and pulls out a worn piece of paper. The camera focuses on the letter as he unfolds it. A faint whispering voice speaks from inside the house: "The cold evening fog has come again." Holmes steps forward from the doorway into the snow. He takes the letter gently from the man's hand with his left hand, his expression analytical and focused. Watson stands beside him, peering out at the fog-covered forest through a window, then turns back to watch Holmes examine the paper intently. The soft crunch of footsteps in fresh snow continues under the ambient sound of a winter breeze.
