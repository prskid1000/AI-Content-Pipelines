Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The man sits in an armchair near the fireplace, his hands resting on the open newspaper. He is reading intently, the flickering firelight casting warm shadows across his face and the surrounding room. Outside the large window, a cold winter morning unfolds with bare trees against a pale sky. A tall man stands by the window, examining footprints on the sill through a magnifying glass. The soft crackle of burning wood blends with the quiet rustling of pages as he turns them one by one.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The man sits in an armchair near the fireplace, his hands resting on the open newspaper. He is reading intently, the flickering firelight casting warm shadows across his face and the surrounding room. Outside the large window, a cold winter morning unfolds with bare trees against a pale sky. A tall man stands by the window, examining footprints on the sill through a magnifying glass. The soft crackle of burning wood blends with the quiet rustling of pages as he turns them one by one.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The man sits in an armchair near the fireplace, his hands resting on the open newspaper. He is reading intently, the flickering firelight casting warm shadows across his face and the surrounding room. Outside the large window, a cold winter morning unfolds with bare trees against a pale sky. A tall man stands by the window, examining footprints on the sill through a magnifying glass. The soft crackle of burning wood blends with the quiet rustling of pages as he turns them one by one.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The male detective Holmes stands still on a cold winter morning in the snow-covered forest, his expression keen as he points at the window sill. The male doctor Watson leans forward in an armchair, lowering his newspaper with curiosity. The sound of wind rustling through pine trees blends with faint footsteps crunching in snow, while a soft creak from the wooden armchair underscores Watson’s movement.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The male detective Holmes stands still on a cold winter morning in the snow-covered forest, his expression keen as he points at the window sill. The male doctor Watson leans forward in an armchair, lowering his newspaper with curiosity. The sound of wind rustling through pine trees blends with faint footsteps crunching in snow, while a soft creak from the wooden armchair underscores Watson’s movement.

Full prompt: Style: realistic - cinematic - The male detective Holmes stands still on a cold winter morning in the snow-covered forest, his expression keen as he points at the window sill. The male doctor Watson leans forward in an armchair, lowering his newspaper with curiosity. The sound of wind rustling through pine trees blends with faint footsteps crunching in snow, while a soft creak from the wooden armchair underscores Watson’s movement.

Full prompt: Style: anime - cozy living room - The young man sits in a dark blue armchair near a fireplace, his hand outstretched as he speaks. He is talking in an incredulous tone saying: "You expect me to believe that?". His brow furrows with skepticism while the fire crackles softly behind him. To the right, another figure stands by a large window overlooking green trees and distant hills under a cloudy sky. This person holds a magnifying glass upright near their face, examining something intently in silence. The only sounds are the gentle pop of the fireplace flames, the soft creaking of wooden furniture settling, and the faint whisper of wind outside the window.
