  - SHOT TYPES: Extreme Wide Shot (EWS) - Establishing shot, shows environment; Wide Shot (WS) - Full body, shows context; Medium Shot (MS) - Waist up, standard dialogue; Medium Close-Up (MCU) - Chest up, more intimate; Close-Up (CU) - Face focus, emotional emphasis; Extreme Close-Up (ECU) - Detail focus, intense emotion; Two-Shot - Two characters in frame; Over-Shoulder (OTS) - One character from behind another; Point of View (POV) - Character's perspective; Dutch Angle - Tilted camera for unease
  - CAMERA MOVEMENTS: Static - No movement, stable composition; Dolly - Camera moves forward/backward on tracks; Track - Camera moves left/right parallel to subject; Pan - Camera rotates horizontally; Tilt - Camera rotates vertically; Zoom - Lens focal length changes; Crane/Jib - Camera moves up/down vertically; Handheld - Shaky, documentary feel; Steadicam - Smooth movement, follows action
  - LIGHTING DIRECTIONS: Key Light - Main light source, position and quality; Fill Light - Softens shadows, position; Back Light - Rim light, separation; Practical Light - Visible light sources in scene (lamps, candles); Natural Light - Window light, time of day quality; Color Temperature - Warm (tungsten 3200K) / Cool (daylight 5600K)
  - TRANSITIONS: Cut - Instant change; Fade In - From black; Fade Out - To black; Dissolve - Overlapping images; Wipe - Geometric transition; Match Cut - Visual continuity; Jump Cut - Abrupt, disorienting

CONSTRAINTS:
- Each PART_x must be at least 7500 characters and 1200 words.
- Each DIALOGUE must be always at least 30 characters.
- Each LOCATION_k must be always at max 12 words. 
- Each DIALOGUE_i.j must have its single corresponding SCENE_i.j, and vice-versa. 
- Each PART_x can span over multiple LOCATION_k. 
- Each LOCATION_k, will be used in multiple SCENE_i.j, keep description consistent and such that it has all objects needed/mentioned in past/current/future scenes. Repeat {{loc_k}} in each SCENE_i.j  where LOCATION_k used for next time. 
- Must Always create a new location(describe independently and completely) when view changes (i.e. new elements added or removed), even in same room or place, e.g. in drawing room, loc_i can be some sitting on sofa, and loc_(i+z) can be sitting on dinning table, though drawing has both sofa and dinning table.
