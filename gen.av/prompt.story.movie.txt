CONTENT:
- Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes Story [Victorian Drama] -> Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of Blue Duckling. 
- Use the narrator(Doctor John Watson himself is the narrator) for atmosphere/background and other detailing.
- Watson, always learning how to do deduction from Holmes, and his loyal assistant and roommate.

- PRODUCTION ELEMENTS:
  - DIALOGUE_EMPHASIS OPTIONS: intense, whispered, urgent, calm, excited, dramatic, sarcastic, emotional, monotone, enthusiastic, fearful, confident, hesitant, commanding, soft, sharp, contemplative, angry, joyful, melancholic, etc.
  - SOUND DESIGN ELEMENTS: Ambient (room tone, background chatter, city sounds, nature sounds), Foley (footsteps, clothing rustle, object handling, door sounds), Effects (explosions, impacts, transitions, whooshes), Environmental (weather sounds, wind, rain, thunder), Musical (score cues, theme variations, stings, transitions)
  - SHOT TYPES: Extreme Wide Shot (EWS) - Establishing shot, shows environment; Wide Shot (WS) - Full body, shows context; Medium Shot (MS) - Waist up, standard dialogue; Medium Close-Up (MCU) - Chest up, more intimate; Close-Up (CU) - Face focus, emotional emphasis; Extreme Close-Up (ECU) - Detail focus, intense emotion; Two-Shot - Two characters in frame; Over-Shoulder (OTS) - One character from behind another; Point of View (POV) - Character's perspective; Dutch Angle - Tilted camera for unease
  - CAMERA MOVEMENTS: Static - No movement, stable composition; Dolly - Camera moves forward/backward on tracks; Track - Camera moves left/right parallel to subject; Pan - Camera rotates horizontally; Tilt - Camera rotates vertically; Zoom - Lens focal length changes; Crane/Jib - Camera moves up/down vertically; Handheld - Shaky, documentary feel; Steadicam - Smooth movement, follows action
  - LIGHTING DIRECTIONS: Key Light - Main light source, position and quality; Fill Light - Softens shadows, position; Back Light - Rim light, separation; Practical Light - Visible light sources in scene (lamps, candles); Natural Light - Window light, time of day quality; Color Temperature - Warm (tungsten 3200K) / Cool (daylight 5600K)
  - TRANSITIONS: Cut - Instant change; Fade In - From black; Fade Out - To black; Dissolve - Overlapping images; Wipe - Geometric transition; Match Cut - Visual continuity; Jump Cut - Abrupt, disorienting

CONSTRAINTS:
- Each PART_x must be at least 7500 characters and 1200 words.
- Each DIALOGUE must be always at least 30 characters.
- Each LOCATION_k must be always at max 12 words. 
- Each DIALOGUE_i.j must have its single corresponding SCENE_i.j, and vice-versa. 
- Each PART_x can span over multiple LOCATION_k. 
- Each LOCATION_k, will be used in multiple SCENE_i.j, keep description consistent and such that it has all objects needed/mentioned in past/current/future scenes. Repeat {{loc_k}} in each SCENE_i.j  where LOCATION_k used for next time. 
- Must Always create a new location(describe independently and completely) when view changes (i.e. new elements added or removed), even in same room or place, e.g. in drawing room, loc_i can be some sitting on sofa, and loc_(i+z) can be sitting on dinning table, though drawing has both sofa and dinning table.
